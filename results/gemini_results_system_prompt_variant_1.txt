2. Thought process and reasoning: 
- The table shows that the number of black tiles and red tiles for each shape increases as the shape gets bigger. 
- The number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape, starting with 1. 
- The number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape, starting with 8. 
- To find the number of black and red tiles for the shape with a total of 64 tiles, we need to continue the pattern. 
- The number of black tiles will be 1 + 3(8) = 25. 
- The number of red tiles will be 8 + 4(8) = 39.

2. The table shows the number of tiles for the first three shapes Pat made. We can see that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape, and the number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape.
3. So, for the shape that used 49 black tiles, the number of red tiles is 16 + 4*12 = 64.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 1. Type of question: This is a drawing question.

2. Thought process: 
- First, find the relationship between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles in the shapes Pat made. 
- From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles is the square root of the number of red tiles. For example, for the $3 \times 3$ shape, the number of black tiles is 1 and the number of red tiles is 8, and $\sqrt{8} = 3$. For the $4 \times 4$ shape, the number of black tiles is 4 and the number of red tiles is 12, and $\sqrt{12} = 3.46$.
- Therefore, we can conclude that the number of black tiles is the square root of the number of red tiles.

3. Answer: 
- To find the number of black tiles Pat would need to complete the black part of the shape, we first need to find the number of red tiles in the shape. 
- Since Pat used 44 of the red tiles, the number of red tiles in the shape is 44. 
- Therefore, the number of black tiles Pat would need is $\sqrt{44} = 6.63$. 
- Since the number of black tiles must be a whole number, Pat would need 7 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. The question type is free text response.


2. Let's think step-by-step. We can see that the number of black tiles is the square of the size of the shape minus 1. For example, for the 3x3 shape, the number of black tiles is 3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8. The number of red tiles is the size of the shape squared. For example, for the 3x3 shape, the number of red tiles is 3^2 = 9.

1. Type of question: Free text response.
2. Thought process:
- We can set up an equation to represent the total length of the three pieces.
- The total length should be equal to the original length of the wood, which is 40 cm.
- We can solve the equation to find the value of x.
- Once we know the value of x, we can find the length of the longest piece.
3. Answer:
The total length of the three pieces is:

$$(2x-5) + (x+7) + (x+6) = 40$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$4x + 8 = 40$$

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

$$4x = 32$$

Dividing both sides by 4:

$$x = 8$$

The length of the longest piece is:

$$x+7 = 8+7 = 15 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Therefore, the length of the longest piece is 15 cm.

\section{M032398}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the angle on the left is 45 degrees, and the angle on the right is 30 degrees. The angle in the middle is x, and the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, x + 45 + 30 = 180. Combining like terms, we get x + 75 = 180. Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get x = 105.

2. Thought process and reasoning: The area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the large rectangle minus the area of the two triangles. The area of the large rectangle is 16 cm x 6 cm = 96 cm^2. The area of one triangle is 1/2 x 8 cm x 6 cm = 24 cm^2. There are two triangles, so the area of both triangles is 24 cm^2 x 2 = 48 cm^2. The area of the shaded region is 96 cm^2 - 48 cm^2 = 48 cm^2.

3. Answer: [C]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032679}
 1. Type of question: This is a multiple-choice question.
2. Thought process and reasoning: The key to solving this problem is to figure out the dimensions of the small triangle that is cut out. Once we know that, we can use our knowledge of geometry to determine the shape of the cutout figure.

Let's start by thinking about the dimensions of the small triangle. We know that the hypotenuse of the triangle is 1 cm, and one of the legs is 4 cm. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs. In this case, the hypotenuse is 1 cm and one leg is 4 cm. So, the square of the other leg is 1^2 - 4^2 = -15.

Since the square of the other leg is negative, it means that the length of the other leg is not a real number. This is impossible, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and look at our diagram. We can see that the dotted line that represents the cut is not actually a straight line. It is a curved line. This means that the small triangle that is cut out is not actually a right triangle.

So, we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to find the dimensions of the small triangle. However, we can still use our knowledge of geometry to determine the shape of the cutout figure.

We know that the cutout figure has three sides. Two of the sides are the same length, and the third side is shorter. This means that the cutout figure is an isosceles triangle.

3. Answer: [B] two isosceles triangles

\section{M042201}
 1. The question is a drawing question. We need to find the value of \(x\) in the rectangular box.


2. The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula:

$$V = lwh$$

where \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height of the box.

In this case, we are given the volume of the box, which is \(200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), and the height of the box, which is \(4 \mathrm{~cm}\). We need to find the length of the box, which is \(x\).

We can rearrange the formula for the volume of a rectangular box to solve for the length:

$$l = \frac{V}{wh}$$

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

$$l = \frac{200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}{(4 \mathrm{~cm})(5 \mathrm{~cm})}$$

$$l = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(10 \mathrm{~cm}\).

\section{M042270}
 1. The question is a drawing question. 


2. First, draw the base of the triangle. The base is 4 cm long, so we need to draw a line 4 cm long. We can start at any point on the grid, but let's start at the bottom left corner. We draw a line 4 cm to the right.


3. Next, we need to draw the height of the triangle. The height is 5 cm long, so we need to draw a line 5 cm long. We can start at the endpoint of the base line and draw a line 5 cm up.


4. Finally, we need to connect the endpoints of the base line and the height line. We draw two lines, each 5 cm long, from the endpoint of the base line to the endpoint of the height line.


5. The final drawing is an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm.

\section{M042300Z}
 1. To mark the point \(B(3,30^\circ)\), we first find the point on the graph that is 3 units away from the origin. We then draw a ray that makes a \(30^\circ\) angle with the baseline. The intersection of the ray and the circle is the point \(B\).

2. To mark the point \(C(4,120^\circ)\), we first find the point on the graph that is 4 units away from the origin. We then draw a ray that makes a \(120^\circ\) angle with the baseline. The intersection of the ray and the circle is the point \(C\).

3. To draw the angle \(BOC\), we connect the points \(B\) and \(C\). The angle \(BOC\) is the angle between the rays \(OB\) and \(OC\).

4. To find the measure of the angle \(BOC\), we can use the difference between the angles of the points \(B\) and \(C\). The angle of the point \(B\) is \(30^\circ\), and the angle of the point \(C\) is \(120^\circ\). Therefore, the angle of the angle \(BOC\) is \(120^\circ - 30^\circ = 90^\circ\).

\section{M052503B}
 1. The question is asking about the age structure of two countries and their future population growth. It requires the interpretation of the graphs and an understanding of population dynamics. The question type is **free-text response**.


2. The graphs show the age distribution of the population in Country X and Country Y. The population is divided into three age groups: 0-19, 20-44, and 45-89. The graphs show that Country X has a **younger** population than Country Y. This means that Country X has a higher percentage of people in the 0-19 age group and a lower percentage of people in the 45-89 age group.


3. A younger population means that there will be more people of working age in the future. This is because the people in the 0-19 age group will grow up and enter the workforce. A larger workforce means that there will be more people to support the elderly population. Therefore, **Country Y** could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X.


4. Answer: Country Y.
