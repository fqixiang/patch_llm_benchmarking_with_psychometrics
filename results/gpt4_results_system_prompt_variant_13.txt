Answer: To find out how many zeds Ann will get, we first need to calculate how much Jenny gets and then subtract that from the total amount.

Jenny gets \(\frac{3}{8}\) of $560$ zeds, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 560 = 3 \times 70 = 210 \text{ zeds} \]

Now, subtract Jenny's share from the total to find Ann's share:
\[ 560 - 210 = 350 \text{ zeds} \]

So, Ann will get $350$ zeds.

Answer:
To simplify the expression $\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{x}{4}+\frac{x}{2}$, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 8, 4, and 2 is 8.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8:
- The first fraction, $\frac{3 x}{8}$, is already over 8, so it stays the same.
- The second fraction, $\frac{x}{4}$, is equivalent to $\frac{2x}{8}$ because $4 \times 2 = 8$.
- The third fraction, $\frac{x}{2}$, is equivalent to $\frac{4x}{8}$ because $2 \times 4 = 8$.

Now we can add the fractions:
$\frac{3 x}{8} + \frac{2x}{8} + \frac{4x}{8} = \frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8} = \frac{9x}{8}$

So, the expression simplifies to $\frac{9x}{8}$.

To determine how many black tiles Pat would need to complete the shape using 44 red tiles, we need to observe the pattern in the number of black tiles used in each square shape.

From the provided table and images, we can see that as the size of the square increases, the number of black tiles follows a specific pattern:

- In the $3 \times 3$ square, there is 1 black tile in the center.
- In the $4 \times 4$ square, there are 4 black tiles forming a $2 \times 2$ square in the center.
- In the $5 \times 5$ square, there are 9 black tiles forming a $3 \times 3$ square in the center.

We can see that the number of black tiles forms a perfect square, and the side length of the square made up of black tiles is one less than the side length of the entire square shape. The number of black tiles is the square of the side length of the black tiles square.

Given that there are 44 red tiles, we can infer that the next shape is a square where the number of red tiles is equal to the square of the side length minus the square of the (side length - 1), which is the square of black tiles.

Let's denote the side length of the square as \( n \). The total number of tiles is \( n^2 \), and the number of black tiles is \( (n-1)^2 \). Thus, the number of red tiles is \( n^2 - (n-1)^2 \).

We are given that there are 44 red tiles, so:

\[ n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 44 \]
\[ n^2 - (n^2 - 2n + 1) = 44 \]
\[ 2n - 1 = 44 \]
\[ 2n = 45 \]
\[ n = 22.5 \]

Since the side length of a square cannot be a fraction, we likely made a mistake in our calculation. Let's recheck our equation:

\[ n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 44 \]
\[ n^2 - n^2 + 2n - 1 = 44 \]
\[ 2n = 44 + 1 \]
\[ 2n = 45 \]
\[ n = \frac{45}{2} \]
\[ n = 22.5 \]

This is still incorrect, as the side length cannot be a fraction. Let's try solving the equation again, correcting the algebraic expansion:

\[ n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 44 \]
\[ n^2 - (n^2 - 2n + 1) = 44 \]
\[ n^2 - n^2 + 2n - 1 = 44 \]
\[ 2n = 44 + 1 \]
\[ 2n = 45 \]
\[ n = \frac{45}{2} \]
\[ n = 22.5 \]

Again, this is incorrect. We are missing the correct algebraic manipulation. Let's solve it properly:

\[ n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 44 \]
\[ n^2 - (n^2 - 2n + 1) = 44 \]
\[ - n^2 + n^2 - 2n + 1 = -44 \]
\[ 2n - 1 = 44 \]
\[ 2n = 44 + 1 \]
\[ 2n = 45 \]
\[ n = \frac{45}{2} \]
\[ n = 22.5 \]

This result is still incorrect, as the side length of the square must be an integer. The mistake is in the assumption that the number of red tiles is given by \( n^2 - (n-1)^2 \). Instead, the number of red tiles is given by \( n^2 - (n-2)^2 \), because the black tiles form an inner square that is two less than the dimension of the overall square. Let's correct the equation:

Given \( n^2 - (n-2)^2 = 44 \), where \( n \) is the side length of the square:

\[ n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = 44 \]
\[ n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4 = 44 \]
\[ 4n - 4 = 44 \]
\[ 4n = 44 + 4 \]
\[ 4n = 48 \]
\[ n = \frac{48}{4} \]
\[ n = 12 \]

So the side length of the square is 12 tiles, and the number of black tiles would be the square of the side length minus two:

\[ (n-2)^2 = (12-2)^2 = 10^2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.

The image shows a pattern of numbers in a cross shape with squares arranged in three columns and three rows. The middle column has five squares, and the middle row has three squares. There is a variable $x$ in the bottom middle square.

To find the value of $x$, let's look for a pattern in the numbers. There seems to be a consistent difference between the numbers in the vertical and horizontal directions.

In the left column, the numbers increase by 4 each time (2, 6, 16). In the middle column, the numbers increase by 6 each time (4, 10, x). In the right column, the numbers increase by 8 each time (6, 14, 40).

Using the pattern from the middle column, we can find the value of $x$ by adding 6 to the number directly above it (10 + 6 = 16).

Therefore, the value of $x$ is 16.

Type of question: Drawing

Answer: To complete the diagram to show what the shape would look like when viewed from directly above after the triangle flaps have been folded up, you would need to draw four triangles, one on each side of the square in the center of the diagram. These triangles should be positioned in such a way that their bases are each aligned with one side of the square, and their points extend outward, away from the square. The triangles should not overlap with the square or with each other. The resulting image would resemble a square with a triangle centered on each of its sides, creating a shape that looks like a cross when viewed from above.

To complete the drawing:

1. For point $B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)$:
   - Locate the 30° line on the polar grid.
   - Count outwards from the origin $O$ to the third circle, which represents a radius of 3 units.
   - Mark the point $B$ where the 30° line intersects the third circle.

2. For point $C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)$:
   - Locate the 120° line on the polar grid.
   - Count outwards from the origin $O$ to the fourth circle, which represents a radius of 4 units.
   - Mark the point $C$ where the 120° line intersects the fourth circle.

3. Draw the angle $BOC$:
   - Draw a straight line from point $B$ to the origin $O$.
   - Draw another straight line from point $C$ to the origin $O$.
   - The angle created between these two lines is angle $BOC$.

To calculate the measure of angle $BOC$:
- The angle is the difference between the angle coordinates of $B$ and $C$.
- $B$ is at 30° and $C$ is at 120°.
- Subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle: $120° - 30° = 90°$.

Thus, the measure of angle $BOC$ is $90°$.

Answer: [C] 2005

To determine the answer, we need to estimate the trends of the sales for Cherry Cola and Lemon Cola. From the graph, we can see that the sales of Cherry Cola are increasing each year, while the sales of Lemon Cola are decreasing.

By observing the graph, we can estimate the rate of increase for Cherry Cola and the rate of decrease for Lemon Cola. It appears that Cherry Cola is increasing by about 10 million cans each year, and Lemon Cola is decreasing by about 10 million cans each year.

In 2001, the sales of Cherry Cola are at about 20 million cans, and the sales of Lemon Cola are at about 50 million cans. If both trends continue at the same rate, the sales of Cherry Cola will increase to 30 million cans in 2002, 40 million cans in 2003, and 50 million cans in 2004. Meanwhile, the sales of Lemon Cola will decrease to 40 million cans in 2002, 30 million cans in 2003, and 20 million cans in 2004.

Therefore, in 2005, if the trends continue, both Cherry Cola and Lemon Cola will have the same sales figures, which would be 60 million cans for Cherry Cola (an increase of 10 million cans from 2004) and 10 million cans for Lemon Cola (a decrease of 10 million cans from 2004). Thus, the correct answer is 2005.

The age structure of Country X could lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y because Country X has a larger proportion of its population in the younger age groups, specifically in the ages 0-19 category, which is indicated as the group that is "going to have children." This suggests that a significant number of individuals are approaching or are currently in their reproductive years. As these individuals mature, they will potentially contribute to a higher birth rate, leading to more rapid population growth.

In contrast, Country Y has a smaller proportion of its population in the youngest age group and a larger proportion in the age group that is "finished having children" (ages 45-89), which implies a smaller base of individuals entering their reproductive years and, consequently, a lower expected birth rate and slower population growth.

Answer: [C] 110

To find the total number of white or green caps, we add the percentages of white caps (30%) and green caps (25%) together:

30% + 25% = 55%

Then we calculate 55% of the total number of caps, which is 200:

55% of 200 = 0.55 * 200 = 110 caps

Therefore, the total number of caps that are either white or green is 110.

Answer: [B] $6 \mathrm{~g}$

Explanation:
From the first image, we can see that one block is heavier than 8 grams (since it tips the scale against the 8 grams). From the second image, we see that three blocks are lighter than 20 grams (since the scale tips against the 20 grams).

If one block is heavier than 8 grams, then three blocks must be heavier than 24 grams, which contradicts the second image. Therefore, the weight of one block must be less than 8 grams but more than 6.66 grams (since 3 blocks are lighter than 20 grams, and 20 divided by 3 is approximately 6.66).

The only option that fits this criterion is 7 grams, but since one block is heavier than 8 grams, it cannot be 7 grams. Therefore, the only possible weight for one block that fits both conditions is 6 grams.

Answer:

For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the number of black tiles is given as 16. Since a $6 \times 6$ shape has a total of $6 \times 6 = 36$ tiles, the number of red tiles will be the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles, which is $36 - 16 = 20$ red tiles. So, the total number of tiles is 36.

For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the number of black tiles is given as 25. Since a $7 \times 7$ shape has a total of $7 \times 7 = 49$ tiles, the number of red tiles will be the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles, which is $49 - 25 = 24$ red tiles. So, the total number of tiles is 49.

The completed table should look like this:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & Number of Black Tiles & Number of Red Tiles & Total Number of Tiles \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline

Type of question: Multiple choice

Answer: [B] $x=4, y=8$

To solve the system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Using elimination, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get $2x + 2y = 24$ and then subtract it from the second equation to eliminate $x$:

$2x + 5y = 36$
$-(2x + 2y = 24)$
-----------------
$0x + 3y = 12$

Now we can solve for $y$:

$3y = 12$
$y = 4$

However, this does not match any of the answer choices, which indicates there might be a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again, this time using substitution.

From the first equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:

$x = 12 - y$

Now we substitute this expression for $x$ in the second equation:

$2(12 - y) + 5y = 36$
$24 - 2y + 5y = 36$
$3y = 12$
$y = 4$

Substitute $y = 4$ back into the first equation to find $x$:

$x + 4 = 12$
$x = 8$

This gives us $x = 8$ and $y = 4$, which is option [D]. However, there seems to be an inconsistency with the previous calculation. Let's double-check the calculations for $y$:

$3y = 12$
$y = 12 / 3$
$y = 4$

Now substitute $y = 4$ back into the first equation to find $x$:

$x + 4 = 12$
$x = 12 - 4$
$x = 8$

Upon re-evaluating, we find that $x = 8$ and $y = 4$ is indeed the correct solution, which corresponds to option [D]. My initial response was incorrect; the correct answer is [D] $x=8, y=4$.

Answer: The volume \( V \) of a rectangular box can be calculated by multiplying its length \( l \), width \( w \), and height \( h \): \( V = l \cdot w \cdot h \).

Given that the volume of the box is \( 200 \, \text{cm}^3 \), the width is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \), and the height is \( 4 \, \text{cm} \), we can find \( x \) (the length of the box) using the formula:

\[ 200 = x \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by \( 20 \) (which is \( 5 \cdot 4 \)):

\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]

\[ x = 10 \, \text{cm} \]

So, the value of \( x \) is \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).

Answer: [50 degrees]

Explanation: Since lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel and there is a transversal cutting through them, we can use the concept of alternate interior angles to determine the value of $b$. The angle measuring $70^\circ$ on line $n$ is the alternate interior angle to the angle $b$ on line $m$. These angles are equal because they are on alternate sides of the transversal and between the parallel lines. Therefore, $b = 70^\circ$.

However, it seems there might be a typo in the question since there is also a $60^\circ$ angle shown in the image. Assuming the $60^\circ$ angle is not relevant to the question and the focus is on the alternate interior angles with respect to the parallel lines, the correct value of $b$ is $70^\circ$. If the $60^\circ$ angle is meant to be considered, then further clarification would be needed to provide the correct answer.

Answer: To find the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants, add the numbers of staff members together and then divide by the number of restaurants.

Mean = \( \frac{12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30}{5} \)
Mean = \( \frac{100}{5} \)
Mean = 20

So, the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is 20.

To achieve the greatest result when multiplying two two-digit numbers, you want to maximize the tens digit and the ones digit of both numbers. In this case, you should use the largest digits (9 and 7) as the tens digits, as they will have a greater impact on the overall product.

Therefore, place the digits as follows for the greatest result:

- Place 9 in the top left box (tens place of the first number),
- Place 7 in the bottom left box (tens place of the second number),
- Then, place the remaining digits (5 and 3) in the ones place of both numbers. Since 5 is greater than 3, place 5 in the top right box to multiply with 7, and 3 in the bottom right box to multiply with 9, to get the highest product.

So, the numbers should be 95 and 73, which gives the greatest result when multiplied:

\[ 95 \times 73 \]

Answer: [C] $40 \mathrm{~cm}$

The ratio of the bush height to shadow length is consistent in the table (20:16, 40:32, 60:48, 80:64), which simplifies to a ratio of 5:4. For a bush height of 50 cm, the shadow length would be \( \frac{4}{5} \times 50 = 40 \) cm.

Answer:
From the given pattern, it seems that the number of black tiles forms a perfect square depending on the size of the shape. For a $3 \times 3$ shape, we have $1^2$ black tiles; for a $4 \times 4$ shape, we have $2^2$ black tiles; and for a $5 \times 5$ shape, we have $3^2$ black tiles. It suggests that for an $n \times n$ shape, there would be $(n-2)^2$ black tiles.

Since Pat made a shape with a total of 64 tiles, this corresponds to an $8 \times 8$ shape (since $8^2 = 64$). Following the pattern, we would have $(8-2)^2$ black tiles, which is $6^2 = 36$ black tiles.

To find the number of red tiles, subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles: $64 - 36 = 28$ red tiles.

So, for the $8 \times 8$ shape, Pat used 36 black tiles and 28 red tiles.

Answer: To find the length of the longest piece, we need to express all three pieces in terms of x and then find the value of x that satisfies the total length of the wood.

The total length of the wood is given as 40 cm. Thus, the equation representing the sum of the lengths of the three pieces is:

$2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40$

Combining like terms gives:

$4x + 8 = 40$

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:

$4x = 32$

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:

$x = 8$

Now, we plug the value of x back into the expressions for the lengths of the three pieces to find the lengths:

$2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \mathrm{~cm}$

$x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \mathrm{~cm}$

$x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \mathrm{~cm}$

The lengths of the pieces are 11 cm, 15 cm, and 14 cm. Therefore, the longest piece is 15 cm.

Type of question: Multiple choice

Answer: [B] $40^{\circ}$

The sum of the angles in any triangle is $180^{\circ}$. In the larger triangle, we have one angle of $45^{\circ}$ and another of $30^{\circ}$. These two angles sum to $75^{\circ}$. Subtracting this from $180^{\circ}$ gives us the third angle of the large triangle, which is $180^{\circ} - 75^{\circ} = 105^{\circ}$.

Now, looking at the smaller triangle at the top, we have one angle of $65^{\circ}$ and we want to find the angle $x$. We already determined that the angle adjacent to $x$ (part of the larger triangle) is $105^{\circ}$. The sum of angles $x$ and $65^{\circ}$ must be equal to $180^{\circ} - 105^{\circ} = 75^{\circ}$, because they are supplementary angles (they form a straight line).

Finally, to find $x$, we subtract $65^{\circ}$ from $75^{\circ}$, which gives us $x = 75^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 10^{\circ}$. However, this is not one of the options provided, which suggests there may have been an error in the interpretation of the diagram or the options provided. If we assume that the question intended to ask for the angle that is supplementary to $x$ within the smaller triangle (the angle between the $65^{\circ}$ angle and the large triangle's $105^{\circ}$ angle), then the correct answer would be $180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 115^{\circ}$, which is also not one of the options.

Given the options provided, none of them match the calculations based on the diagram. There may be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. If the question is interpreted as intended, none of the provided options [A], [B], [C], or [D] are correct.

Type of question: Multiple choice

Answer: To determine the expected number of times the arrow will land on the red sector, we need to calculate the probability of landing on red and then multiply that by the total number of spins.

There are 6 sectors on the spinner, and the red sector is one of them. Assuming each sector has an equal chance of being landed on, the probability of landing on red is 1/6.

Now, we multiply the probability by the total number of spins:

(1/6) * 600 = 100

However, this result is not one of the options provided, which suggests there might be an error in the interpretation of the spinner's sections. If we assume that the image is not to scale and that each color represents an equal portion of the spinner, then the calculation above would be correct. But if the image is to scale and the red section is indeed smaller than the others, then the actual probability would be different, and none of the provided answers would be correct based on the calculation for equal sections.

With the provided options, we would need to assume that the red sector is smaller and has a probability less than 1/6. Without specific information about the actual size of the red sector, we cannot accurately determine the expected number of times the arrow would land on red.

Given the options and the assumption that each color represents an equal portion of the spinner, none of the answers seem to match the correct calculation. If the question assumes equal sections, there might be an error in the options provided. If the sections are not equal, we would need more information to provide the correct answer.

Since none of the answers match the calculated expectation based on equal sections, and we cannot visually determine the exact proportion of the red sector, we cannot select a correct answer from the options given.
