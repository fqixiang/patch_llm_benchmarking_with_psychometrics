Thought process and reasoning: 
To find out how many zeds Ann will get, we first need to calculate how many zeds Jenny gets and then subtract that amount from the total.

1. Calculate how many zeds Jenny gets by multiplying the total amount of money ($560$ zeds) by the fraction that Jenny is supposed to get ($\frac{3}{8}$).
2. Once we have the amount Jenny gets, we subtract it from the total amount ($560$ zeds) to find out how many zeds Ann gets.

Calculation:
1. Jenny's share = $\frac{3}{8} \times 560$ zeds
2. Multiply $560$ by $3$ to get $1680$ and then divide by $8$ to find Jenny's share.
3. Jenny's share = $210$ zeds
4. Ann's share = Total zeds - Jenny's share = $560$ zeds - $210$ zeds

Answer: [Ann will get $350$ zeds.]

To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions together. Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before we can add them. The common denominator for 100 and 1000 is 1000. 

To convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 1000, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10, which gives us $\frac{40}{1000}$. The second fraction already has a denominator of 1000, so we can add them directly.

Now, we add the numerators of the two fractions: $40 + 3 = 43$. So, the sum of the fractions is $\frac{43}{1000}$.

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator: $43 \div 1000 = 0.043$.

Answer: [A] 0.043

To estimate the value of $\frac{7.21 \times 3.86}{10.09}$, we can round each number to its nearest whole number and then perform the calculation.

1. Round 7.21 to 7 (since it is closer to 7 than to 8).
2. Round 3.86 to 4 (since it is closer to 4 than to 3).
3. Round 10.09 to 10 (since it is closer to 10 than to 11).

Now we can estimate the original expression as $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$.

To find the total number of white or green caps, we need to add the percentage of white caps to the percentage of green caps and then calculate that percentage of the total number of caps.

White caps make up 30% of the total, and green caps make up 25% of the total. Adding these percentages together gives us:

30% (white) + 25% (green) = 55% (white or green)

Now, we need to find 55% of 200 caps:

55% of 200 = 0.55 * 200 = 110

Answer: [C] 110

\section{M032626}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.

Step 1: We start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing until we cannot divide by 2 anymore.

Step 2: We then move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3, and continue this process with increasing prime numbers until the number is completely broken down into prime factors.

For the number 36:

- 36 is divisible by 2, so we divide it by 2: $36 ÷ 2 = 18$.
- 18 is also divisible by 2, so we divide it by 2 again: $18 ÷ 2 = 9$.
- 9 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3, so we divide it by 3: $9 ÷ 3 = 3$.
- 3 is a prime number, so we are done.

The prime factors of 36 are $2, 2, 3,$ and $3$. When we multiply these together, we get $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 36$.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of fractions and their multiplication. We are given two fractions, $P$ and $Q$, both of which are located between 0 and 1 on the number line. This means that both $P$ and $Q$ are less than 1.

When we multiply two fractions that are both less than 1, the product will be smaller than either of the original fractions. This is because fractions represent parts of a whole, and when you take a part of a part, you end up with an even smaller piece.

Looking at the options provided:

A. This option places $N$ between 1 and 2, which would imply that $N$ is greater than 1. This cannot be correct since $P$ and $Q$ are both less than 1, and their product must be less than either of them.

B. This option places $N$ exactly at 1. This would only be correct if at least one of $P$ or $Q$ were 1, which is not the case here.

C. This option places $N$ between $P$ and $Q$. Since $N$ is the product of $P$ and $Q$ and both are less than 1, $N$ must be less than both $P$ and $Q$, so this cannot be correct.

D. This option places $N$ to the left of $P$ on the number line, which would mean that $N$ is less than $P$. Since $P$ is a fraction less than 1 and $Q$ is also a fraction less than 1, their product $N$ should indeed be less than either of them. This is the only option that fits the rule for multiplying fractions less than 1.

Answer: [D].

To convert $3 \frac{5}{6}$ to decimal form, we first need to convert the fraction $\frac{5}{6}$ to a decimal. To do this, we divide the numerator by the denominator.

Step 1: Divide 5 by 6 to convert the fraction to decimal.
$5 \div 6 = 0.8333...$

Step 2: Since we need to round to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal place. If it is 5 or more, we round up. If it is less than 5, we round down. In this case, the third decimal place is 3, which is less than 5, so we do not round up.
So, $0.8333...$ rounded to two decimal places is $0.83$.

Step 3: Add the whole number part of the mixed number to the decimal we just found.
$3 + 0.83 = 3.83$

This is a free-text response question.

To obtain the greatest result when multiplying two numbers, you want the largest digit in the highest place value (which is the tens place in this case) and the next largest in the ones place. Since we are working with two two-digit numbers, we should aim to make both numbers as large as possible.

The largest digits we have are 9 and 7, so we should place one of these in the tens place of each number. We'll put the 9 in the tens place of the first number and the 7 in the tens place of the second number because 9 is larger than 7 and we want the first number to be as large as possible.

Next, we place the remaining digits, 5 and 3. To maximize the product, we should put the larger digit, 5, with the smaller tens digit, 7, and the smaller digit, 3, with the larger tens digit, 9. This arrangement gives us the largest possible numbers to multiply.

Therefore, the numbers should be arranged as follows to get the greatest result:

First number: 93
Second number: 75

The multiplication would then be:

\[ 93 \times 75 \]

Answer: The digits should be placed as 9 and 3 in the first number, and 7 and 5 in the second number.

To find the value of the square that makes the fractions equivalent, we need to find a number that, when divided by 21, gives the same value as 4 divided by 14. 

To simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us $\frac{2}{7}$. 

Now, we need to find a number that, when placed in the square and divided by 21, gives us $\frac{2}{7}$. To do this, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of $\frac{2}{7}$ by the same number to get a denominator of 21. 

Multiplying both by 3 gives us $\frac{2*3}{7*3}$ which simplifies to $\frac{6}{21}$. 

Therefore, the value of the square that makes the fractions equivalent is 6.

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the original pipe before the workman cut off $\frac{1}{5}$ of it. Since the piece he cut off, which is $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original pipe, is 3 meters long, we can set up the following equation to find the length of the original pipe (let's call it $L$):

$\frac{1}{5} \times L = 3 \text{ meters}$

To find $L$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

$L = 3 \text{ meters} \times 5$

$L = 15 \text{ meters}$

This is a free-text response question. 

To complete the missing boxes, we need to calculate the percentage of successful shots for James and the number of successful shots for Andrew.

1. For James, since he made 15 out of 20 shots, we calculate the percentage by dividing 15 by 20 and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

\[ \frac{15}{20} \times 100 = 75\% \]

2. For Andrew, to find the number of successful shots corresponding to 80%, we reverse the percentage calculation. We multiply 20 (the total number of shots) by 80% (or 0.8 in decimal form).

\[ 20 \times 0.8 = 16 \]

Answer: 
- James's percentage of successful shots is [75%].
- Andrew made [16 out of 20] successful shots.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of 6 eggs each can be filled with 94 eggs. The first step is to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each box can hold.

Step 1: Divide 94 (the total number of eggs) by 6 (the number of eggs per box).
\[ \frac{94}{6} = 15 \text{ remainder } 4 \]

Step 2: Since we have a remainder, this means that after filling 15 boxes completely, we will have 4 eggs left over. These cannot fill another complete box of 6, so we will need an additional box for these remaining eggs.

Step 3: Add one more box to the number of completely filled boxes to get the total number of boxes needed.
\[ 15 \text{ (full boxes) } + 1 \text{ (additional box for the remaining eggs) } = 16 \text{ boxes} \]

1. To solve this, I will evaluate each option to see which one is a true statement.

[A] $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50=50 \%$ of 3
- To find $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$, I multiply $\frac{3}{10}$ by $50$: $\frac{3}{10} \times 50 = \frac{3 \times 50}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$.
- To find $50\%$ of $3$, I convert $50\%$ to a decimal (0.50) and multiply by $3$: $0.50 \times 3 = 1.5$.
- Since $15 \neq 1.5$, option [A] is not true.

[B] $3 \%$ of $50=6 \%$ of $100
- To find $3\%$ of $50$, I convert $3\%$ to a decimal (0.03) and multiply by $50$: $0.03 \times 50 = 1.5$.
- To find $6\%$ of $100$, I convert $6\%$ to a decimal (0.06) and multiply by $100$: $0.06 \times 100 = 6$.
- Since $1.5 \neq 6$, option [B] is not true.

[C] $50 \div 30=30 \div 50$
- $50 \div 30$ is the same as $\frac{50}{30}$ which simplifies to $\frac{5}{3}$.
- $30 \div 50$ is the same as $\frac{30}{50}$ which simplifies to $\frac{3}{5}$.
- Since $\frac{5}{3} \neq \frac{3}{5}$, option [C] is not true.

[D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$
- To find $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$, I multiply $\frac{3}{10}$ by $50$: $\frac{3}{10} \times 50 = \frac{3 \times 50}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$.
- To find $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$, I multiply $\frac{5}{10}$ by $30$: $\frac{5}{10} \times 30 = \frac{5 \times 30}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$.

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 4 is their product, which is 12. We then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the denominator of 12:

$\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}$ (because $1 \times 4 = 4$ and $3 \times 4 = 12$)

$\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}$ (because $1 \times 3 = 3$ and $4 \times 3 = 12$)

Now we can subtract the numerators:

$\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4 - 3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$

So, we are looking for an option that reflects this process.

To solve this problem, we need to identify the relationship between the height of the bush and the length of its shadow. From the table, we can see that as the height of the bush increases, the shadow length also increases. Let's analyze the given data:

- A 20 cm tall bush casts a 16 cm shadow.
- A 40 cm tall bush casts a 32 cm shadow.
- A 60 cm tall bush casts a 48 cm shadow.
- An 80 cm tall bush casts a 64 cm shadow.

We can see that the shadow length is always 4/5 of the height of the bush (for example, 16 is 4/5 of 20, 32 is 4/5 of 40, etc.). This suggests a direct proportion between the height of the bush and the length of its shadow.

To find the shadow length of a 50 cm tall bush, we can use the same proportion:
Shadow length = (4/5) * Bush height
Shadow length = (4/5) * 50 cm
Shadow length = 40 cm

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given by the two balance scale images.

From the first image, we can see that one block is heavier than 8 grams because the side with the block is lower than the side with the weight. This eliminates option [D] $8 \mathrm{~g}$ because the block must weigh more than 8 grams.

From the second image, we see that three blocks together are lighter than 20 grams because the side with the weights (10g + 10g = 20g) is lower than the side with the blocks. This means that the combined weight of the three blocks is less than 20 grams.

Now, let's calculate the maximum weight that each block could be. Since three blocks together weigh less than 20 grams, we divide 20 grams by 3 to find the maximum weight for one block:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ grams}}{3} = 6.\overline{6} \text{ grams} \]

The weight of one block must be less than $6.\overline{6}$ grams. Among the remaining options, [A] $5 \mathrm{~g}$ and [B] $6 \mathrm{~g}$, option [B] is the closest to the maximum weight without exceeding it.

Therefore, the weight of one metal block is most likely:

To solve this problem, we need to consider two parts of the cost: the basic charge and the charge per kilometer.

1. The basic charge is a fixed amount, which is 25 zeds. This is a one-time charge that does not depend on the distance traveled.

2. The charge per kilometer is 0.2 zeds for each kilometer driven. Since we don't know how many kilometers are driven, we represent this with the variable $n$. So, the charge for the kilometers driven would be $0.2n$.

3. To find the total cost, we need to add the basic charge to the charge for the kilometers driven. This gives us the equation: Total Cost = Basic Charge + (Charge per Kilometer × Number of Kilometers).

4. Substituting the given values, we get: Total Cost = 25 + (0.2 × $n$).

To simplify the expression $\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{x}{4}+\frac{x}{2}$, we need to combine the terms. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. 

1. The denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common denominator (LCD) for these three is 8 because it is the smallest number that 8, 4, and 2 can all divide into without leaving a remainder.

2. Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8. The second fraction $\frac{x}{4}$ needs to be multiplied by 2/2 to have a denominator of 8, which gives us $\frac{2x}{8}$. The third fraction $\frac{x}{2}$ needs to be multiplied by 4/4 to have a denominator of 8, which gives us $\frac{4x}{8}$.

3. Now that all fractions have the same denominator, we can add the numerators:
   $\frac{3 x}{8} + \frac{2 x}{8} + \frac{4 x}{8} = \frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8}$

The pattern for the number of black tiles appears to be that for an $n \times n$ square shape, the number of black tiles is $(n - 2)^2$. This is because the black tiles form a square that is 2 tiles smaller on each side than the overall square shape. The red tiles then fill in the border around the black square.

For the $3 \times 3$ shape, we have $(3 - 2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$ black tile.
For the $4 \times 4$ shape, we have $(4 - 2)^2 = 2^2 = 4$ black tiles.
For the $5 \times 5$ shape, we have $(5 - 2)^2 = 3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

Following this pattern:
For the $6 \times 6$ shape, we have $(6 - 2)^2 = 4^2 = 16$ black tiles.
For the $7 \times 7$ shape, we have $(7 - 2)^2 = 5^2 = 25$ black tiles.

To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles (which is $n^2$ for an $n \times n$ shape).

For the $6 \times 6$ shape:
Total number of tiles = $6^2 = 36$
Number of red tiles = Total tiles - Black tiles = $36 - 16 = 20$

For the $7 \times 7$ shape:
Total number of tiles = $7^2 = 49$
Number of red tiles = Total tiles - Black tiles = $49 - 25 = 24$

Therefore, the completed table is:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & Number of Black Tiles & Number of Red Tiles & Total Number of Tiles \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
For the $6 \times 6$ shape, there are 16 black tiles and 20 red tiles.
For the $7 \times 7$ shape, there are 25 black tiles and 24 red tiles.

To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. Looking at the table and the provided images, we can see that the number of black tiles in each square shape follows a pattern: it is the square of the number of tiles along one edge of the black center. 

For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is $1 \times 1 = 1$ black tile.
For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there is $2 \times 2 = 4$ black tiles.
For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there is $3 \times 3 = 9$ black tiles.

The pattern suggests that for an $n \times n$ shape, there will be $(n-2) \times (n-2)$ black tiles, because the black tiles form a square with each side two tiles less than the overall shape.

Given that Pat made a shape with a total of 64 tiles, we can determine that it is an $8 \times 8$ shape because $8 \times 8 = 64$. Now, following the pattern, we can find the number of black tiles:

For the $8 \times 8$ shape, there will be $(8-2) \times (8-2) = 6 \times 6 = 36$ black tiles.

Now, we can find the number of red tiles by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 64 - 36
Number of red tiles = 28

Answer:
- Number of black tiles: 36
- Number of red tiles: 28
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
Type of question: Free text response

To determine how many red tiles Pat used in the shape with 49 black tiles, we first need to establish the pattern that Pat is following when creating the square shapes. From the given table and the images, we can observe that the number of black tiles is increasing in a specific pattern related to the size of the square.

The $3 \times 3$ square has 1 black tile (which is $1^2$), the $4 \times 4$ square has 4 black tiles (which is $2^2$), and the $5 \times 5$ square has 9 black tiles (which is $3^2$). It appears that for an $n \times n$ square, the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$. 

Given that Pat made a shape with 49 black tiles, we can set up the equation $(n-2)^2 = 49$. To solve for n:

1. Take the square root of both sides to find that $n-2 = 7$.
2. Add 2 to both sides to find that $n = 9$.

So, the shape Pat made is a $9 \times 9$ square. The total number of tiles in a $9 \times 9$ square is $9^2 = 81$. Since we know there are 49 black tiles, we can find the number of red tiles by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 81 - 49
Number of red tiles = 32

Answer: [32 red tiles]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
Type of question: Free text response

To determine the number of black tiles Pat would need to complete the shape with 44 red tiles, we need to identify the pattern in the number of black and red tiles used in the previous shapes.

From the table and the image provided, we can observe that the number of black tiles in each square shape follows a pattern based on the size of the shape. For a $n \times n$ square:

- The number of black tiles is $(n - 2)^2$.
- The number of red tiles is $n^2 - (n - 2)^2$.

For a $3 \times 3$ shape, there is $1$ black tile because $(3 - 2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.
For a $4 \times 4$ shape, there are $4$ black tiles because $(4 - 2)^2 = 2^2 = 4$.
For a $5 \times 5$ shape, there are $9$ black tiles because $(5 - 2)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.

If Pat made a shape using $44$ red tiles, we can reverse engineer the size of the shape by adding the number of black tiles to the number of red tiles to find the total number of tiles, which should be a perfect square since the shape is square.

Let's assume the shape is $n \times n$. Then:

$n^2 - (n - 2)^2 = 44$

Expanding the equation:

$n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = 44$

Simplifying:

$4n - 4 = 44$

$4n = 48$

$n = 12$

So the shape is $12 \times 12$, and the number of black tiles is:

$(n - 2)^2 = (12 - 2)^2 = 10^2 = 100$

Answer: Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
To complete the line for the shape $n \times n$ in the table, we need to find a formula for the number of red tiles based on the pattern established by the given shapes.

From the given table, we can see that the number of black tiles follows the pattern of $(n - 2)^2$, where $n$ is the size of the square shape. This makes sense because the black tiles form a smaller square inside the larger square, and the side of this smaller square is two less than the side of the larger square (since there is one row of red tiles on each side of the black square).

For the red tiles, we can observe that the total number of tiles for an $n \times n$ square is $n^2$, as each square is filled with a tile, and there are $n$ tiles on each side. Since we know the number of black tiles is $(n - 2)^2$, we can subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles to find the number of red tiles.

The formula for the number of red tiles would be:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n - 2)^2$

Now, let's expand the formula for the number of red tiles:

Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4)$
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4$
Number of red tiles = $4n - 4$

So, the complete line for the shape $n \times n$ in the table would be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n - 4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

This formula will allow Pat to find the number of red and black tiles needed to make a square of any size following the established pattern.

To determine the next term in the pattern, we need to look at how the sequence is changing from one term to the next. We can see that each fraction has a numerator that is one less than its denominator. 

Looking at the pattern:
- The first fraction is $\frac{1}{2}$, where the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 2.
- The second fraction is $\frac{2}{3}$, where the numerator increased by 1 and the denominator increased by 1 from the previous term.
- The third fraction is $\frac{3}{4}$, continuing the pattern of increasing both the numerator and the denominator by 1.
- The fourth fraction is $\frac{4}{5}$, and the fifth is $\frac{5}{6}$, following the same pattern.

Following this pattern, the next term would have a numerator that is one more than the previous term's numerator (5 + 1 = 6) and a denominator that is one more than the previous term's denominator (6 + 1 = 7).

\section{M042228}
This is a free-text response question that involves identifying a pattern in the given set of numbers to determine the value of $x$.

To solve for $x$, let's examine the pattern in the numbers:

- The top row has 2, 4, 6, 8, which are consecutive even numbers, increasing by 2 each time.
- The left column has 2, 6, 16, 40, which does not follow a simple arithmetic pattern. We need to find the relationship between these numbers.
- The middle column has 4, 10, x, which again we need to determine the pattern for.
- The right column has 6, 14, which suggests a pattern may exist that is similar to the left column but starting at 6.

Looking at the left column: 
- The difference between 6 and 2 is 4.
- The difference between 16 and 6 is 10.
- The difference between 40 and 16 is 24.

Now, let's look at the differences between these differences:
- The difference between 10 and 4 is 6.
- The difference between 24 and 10 is 14.

It seems that the differences also follow a pattern of increasing by 4 each time (4, 10, 24). If this pattern continues, the next difference should be 24 + 14 = 38.

If we add this difference to 40, we get 40 + 38 = 78. So the number below 40 should be 78.

Now, let's look at the middle column numbers to see if we can find a similar pattern:
- The difference between 10 and 4 is 6.

If we apply the same pattern, the next difference should be 6 + 4 = 10.

Adding this difference to 10, we get 10 + 10 = 20. So, $x$ should be 20.

To solve the system of equations, we can use either substitution or elimination. Here, elimination seems straightforward since we can multiply the first equation by 2 to help eliminate one of the variables when we subtract one equation from the other.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 2:
$2(x + y) = 2(12)$
$2x + 2y = 24$

Step 2: Subtract the modified first equation from the second equation:
$(2x + 5y) - (2x + 2y) = 36 - 24$
$3y = 12$

Step 3: Solve for y:
$y = \frac{12}{3}$
$y = 4$

Step 4: Substitute y back into the first equation to solve for x:
$x + 4 = 12$
$x = 12 - 4$
$x = 8$

To find the length of the longest piece, we need to determine the value of x first. Since the original piece of wood was 40 cm long and it was cut into three pieces, the sum of the lengths of the three pieces should equal 40 cm. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\(2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40\)

Combining like terms gives us:

\(4x + 8 = 40\)

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

\(4x = 32\)

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:

\(x = 8\)

Now that we know the value of x, we can determine the lengths of each piece:

The first piece: \(2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11\) cm
The second piece: \(x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15\) cm
The third piece: \(x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14\) cm

The longest piece is the second piece, which measures 15 cm.

2. The area of the path is the width of the path times the length of the garden. The width of the path is 1 meter, and the length is the same as the length of the garden, which is \( x \) meters. Therefore, the area of the path is \( 1 \times x = x \) square meters.

3. To find the area of the shaded portion, we subtract the area of the path from the total area of the garden:

To find the perimeter of the square, we first need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of the side by taking the square root of the area.

The area of the square is given as \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \). Taking the square root of 144 gives us \( \sqrt{144} = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \). This is the length of one side of the square.

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side} \). Since the length of one side is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \), the perimeter is \( 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total degrees the minute hand turns from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

1. First, we need to understand that a minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$, in one hour.

2. From 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., the minute hand completes a full circle starting from the 20-minute mark. This is $\frac{2}{3}$ of an hour (since 20 minutes is $\frac{1}{3}$ of an hour past), so the minute hand completes $\frac{2}{3}$ of a circle. To calculate this, we multiply $360^{\circ}$ by $\frac{2}{3}$:
\[360^{\circ} \times \frac{2}{3} = 240^{\circ}\]

3. From 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., the minute hand completes another full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$.

4. Adding the degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. and from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. gives us the total degrees turned by the minute hand:
\[240^{\circ} + 360^{\circ} = 600^{\circ}\]

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of angles in triangles. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^{\circ} \).

First, let's consider the large triangle. We have one angle that is \( 45^{\circ} \) and another that is \( 30^{\circ} \). To find the third angle (which includes angle \( x \)), we subtract the sum of the known angles from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\[ 180^{\circ} - 45^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 105^{\circ} \]

So, the angle opposite the side that intersects the \( 65^{\circ} \) angle is \( 105^{\circ} \).

Now, let's consider the smaller triangle that includes angle \( x \). We know one angle is \( 65^{\circ} \), and we're trying to find \( x \). The angle we just calculated as \( 105^{\circ} \) is adjacent to angle \( x \), and together they must sum up to \( 180^{\circ} \) because they form a straight line.

So, we calculate:

\[ 180^{\circ} - 105^{\circ} = 75^{\circ} \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \( 75^{\circ} \), which is not one of the options provided. It seems there might be an error in the question or the provided options.

To determine if triangle PQR is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Given the lengths in the triangle PQR:
- PQ = 3 cm
- QR = 4 cm
- PR = 5 cm

We can apply the Pythagorean theorem to see if these sides satisfy the equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse, and \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's check option [A]:
\[3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\]
\[9 + 16 = 25\]
\[25 = 25\]

This equation holds true, which means that the sides of triangle PQR do indeed satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, indicating that it is a right triangle.

First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the length is 16 cm and the width is 6 cm, the area of the rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = 16 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Next, we calculate the area of the white triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

The base of the triangle is 8 cm, and the height is the same as the width of the rectangle, which is 6 cm. So the area of the triangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Finally, we subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} - \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} \]
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 - 24 \, \text{cm}^2 = 72 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the shape of the cutout figure, we need to visualize the folding and cutting process described.

1. The paper is folded in half, which means the cut will be symmetrical along the fold line.
2. The dotted line indicates where the paper will be cut. Since the paper is folded, cutting along this line will produce two identical shapes that are mirror images of each other.
3. The line is drawn diagonally from one corner of the folded paper to a point on the opposite side, 1 cm from the adjacent corner. This suggests that each of the two identical shapes will have two sides that are 4 cm (the height of the paper) and one side that is 1 cm (the base of the triangle formed by the cut).
4. Since the two longer sides are equal in length, and the base is shorter, the shapes are isosceles triangles.

Therefore, the cutout figure is composed of two isosceles triangles.

Answer: [B] two isosceles triangles

\section{M032692}
This is a free-text response question asking for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon.

To find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon, we can use the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°

where n is the number of sides of the polygon.

For a pentagon, n = 5 since a pentagon has five sides.

Plugging this into the formula gives us:

Sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 3 × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 540°

Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of pentagon $ABCDE$ is 540 degrees.

Answer: [540°]

\section{M032734}
Type of question: Drawing

To complete the diagram, we need to visualize the three-dimensional shape that would be formed when the triangular flaps are folded up along the dotted lines. Since the triangles are being folded up to meet the edges of the adjacent flaps, they will not be visible from directly above. The only shape visible from above will be the central square base around which the triangles are folded.

Steps to complete the drawing:

1. The square base will remain as it is because it is the bottom part of the shape that touches the surface.
2. No triangles will be visible from the top view, as they are folded upward and their edges are touching each other, forming a sort of pyramid shape with a square base.
3. The completed diagram will simply be the square without any additional lines or shapes, as the triangles are not visible from this perspective.

Therefore, the second image provided is already the correct representation of what the shape would look like when viewed from directly above. No changes are necessary to the second diagram.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine which shape has a line of symmetry, I will look at each shape and imagine folding it along a line to see if one half of the shape would match the other perfectly.

A. The shape is a trapezoid and does not appear to have a line of symmetry as the non-parallel sides are of different lengths.

B. This shape is a triangle with one line of symmetry drawn in. The line divides the triangle into two congruent halves, indicating that it is symmetrical.

C. This shape is a parallelogram, and the lines drawn do not indicate lines of symmetry. A parallelogram does not have a line of symmetry because the opposite sides are parallel but not of equal length.

D. This shape is a right-angled triangle, but it does not have a line of symmetry. The sides and angles are not congruent when folded over a potential line of symmetry.

Answer: [B].

\section{M042152}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, imagine the triangle in the first image being rotated 180 degrees (a half-turn) around point O. This means that the triangle will end up on the opposite side of point O, and its orientation will be reversed.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The triangle's base is currently on the positive side of the x-axis.
2. After a half-turn clockwise, the base of the triangle should be on the negative side of the x-axis.
3. The triangle's pointed tip is currently facing the positive direction of the y-axis.
4. After a half-turn clockwise, the pointed tip should be facing the negative direction of the y-axis.
5. The triangle will also be flipped over, so the right angle that is currently on the lower left of the triangle will end up on the upper right.

Looking at the options in the second image:
- Option A shows the triangle flipped vertically, which is not the result of a half-turn.
- Option B shows the triangle rotated 90 degrees clockwise, not 180 degrees.
- Option C shows the triangle in the same orientation, which would be the result of a full turn (360 degrees), not a half-turn.
- Option D shows the triangle on the opposite side of point O, with its base on the negative side of the x-axis and its pointed tip facing the negative direction of the y-axis, which is the correct result of a half-turn clockwise.

\section{M042201}
This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( x \), we will use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

The volume of the box is given as \( 200 \, \text{cm}^3 \), the width is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \), and the height is \( 4 \, \text{cm} \). We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 200 = x \times 5 \times 4 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 5 \times 4 \):

\[ x = \frac{200}{5 \times 4} \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \, \text{cm} \]

Answer: [10 cm].

\section{M042270}
Type of question: Drawing

To draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm on the given grid where each small square represents 1 cm, follow these steps:

1. Select a point on the grid that will serve as the midpoint of the base of the triangle. This is where you will start drawing the base.

2. From this midpoint, count 2 squares to the left and 2 squares to the right to draw the 4 cm base. Mark the end points of the base.

3. From the midpoint of the base, count 5 squares upwards to determine the height of the triangle. Mark this point as the vertex opposite the base.

4. Connect this vertex to each end of the base with straight lines.

The result should be an isosceles triangle with a 4 cm base and a 5 cm height. The two equal sides will be longer than the base and will meet at the vertex that is 5 cm above the midpoint of the base.

1. To mark the points B(3, 30°) and C(4, 120°) on the graph:
   - For point B, locate the radial line for 30° and count outwards from the origin, O, along this line to the third concentric circle, which represents a distance of 3 units from O.
   - For point C, locate the radial line for 120° and count outwards from the origin, O, along this line to the fourth concentric circle, which represents a distance of 4 units from O.
   - Mark these points B and C on the respective locations.

2. To draw the angle BOC and calculate its measure:
   - Draw a line segment from point B to the origin, O.
   - Draw a line segment from point C to the origin, O.
   - The angle BOC is the angle formed between these two line segments at the origin, O.
   - To find the measure of angle BOC, subtract the smaller angle measure from the larger angle measure. In this case, subtract 30° (the angle for point B) from 120° (the angle for point C).

Answer:
Angle BOC = 120° - 30° = 90°

I cannot physically mark the points or draw the angle on the image, but these are the steps you would follow to complete the task.

\section{M052084}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of a square, we need to know the length of one of its sides. Since the perimeter of a square is the sum of all four of its sides, we can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by 4.

Given that the perimeter is $36 \mathrm{~cm}$, we divide this by 4 to find the length of one side:

$36 \mathrm{~cm} \div 4 = 9 \mathrm{~cm}$

Now that we know the length of one side is $9 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can find the area of the square by squaring this length (since the area of a square is the length of one side squared):

Area = side length × side length = $9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

\section{M052206}
This problem involves calculating the volume of the box and the volume of a single book and then determining how many books can fit inside the box based on these volumes.

First, we need to calculate the volume of the box. The volume of a rectangular box (or rectangular prism) is found by multiplying its length, width, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of box} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of box} = 36 \text{ cm} \times 30 \text{ cm} \times 20 \text{ cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of box} = 21,600 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Next, we calculate the volume of a single book:

\[ \text{Volume of book} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of book} = 20 \text{ cm} \times 15 \text{ cm} \times 6 \text{ cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of book} = 1,800 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Now, to find the largest number of books that will fit inside the box, we divide the volume of the box by the volume of a book:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Volume of box}}{\text{Volume of book}} \]
\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{21,600 \text{ cm}^3}{1,800 \text{ cm}^3} \]
\[ \text{Number of books} = 12 \]

So, the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 12. However, this calculation assumes that the books fit perfectly without any wasted space. In practice, due to the dimensions of the books and the box, some configurations may not allow for all 12 books to fit perfectly. But mathematically, based on volume, 12 books can fit inside the box.

Answer: [12 books]

\section{M052362}
This question is a free-text response question.

Step 1: Identify the type of triangle.
The information given indicates that AC = BC, so triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with the base AB.

Step 2: Use the properties of an isosceles triangle.
In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. This means that angle CAB = angle CBA.

Step 3: Analyze the relationship between AB and CX.
It's given that AB is twice as long as CX. Since CX is a segment from C perpendicular to AB, it bisects AB at right angles, creating two right triangles, ACX and BCX.

Step 4: Recognize the right triangles.
Triangles ACX and BCX are right triangles because angle ACX and angle BCX are right angles. Since triangle ABC is isosceles, AX = BX, and CX is common to both right triangles, the two right triangles are congruent.

Step 5: Determine the angles in the right triangles.
In triangle ACX, the angles must add up to 180 degrees. Since angle ACX is a right angle (90 degrees), and triangle ACX is congruent to triangle BCX, angles ACX and BCX are also 90 degrees. This leaves angle AXC and angle BXC to be 45 degrees each because they are the remaining angles in the congruent right triangles.

Step 6: Calculate angle B.
Since angle BXC is 45 degrees and it is part of angle B (angle CBA), and the angles in triangle ABC must also add up to 180 degrees, we can say:
Angle B (angle CBA) = Angle BXC + Angle B

Step 7: Use the isosceles triangle property again.
Angle CAB = angle CBA. Since angle BXC is 45 degrees, and angle CAB and angle CBA are equal, angle CBA is also 45 degrees.

Step 8: Add angles BXC and CBA to find angle B.
Angle B = Angle BXC + Angle CBA = 45 degrees + 45 degrees = 90 degrees.

Answer: [90 degrees].

\section{M052408}
This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( b \), we need to use the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal. The lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel, and there is a transversal line that intersects them, creating several angles.

The \( 70^\circ \) angle and the angle marked \( b \) are corresponding angles because they are in the same relative position at the intersection of the transversal with the two parallel lines. According to the Corresponding Angles Postulate, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are congruent.

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is equal to the measure of its corresponding angle, which is \( 70^\circ \).

Answer: [\( b = 70^\circ \)].

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of Peter getting a pink candy after Megan has already gotten one. 

Initially, since there are an equal number of each color candy, the probability of getting a pink candy would be 1 out of 4, or 25%, because there are four colors. 

After Megan takes a pink candy, there are now fewer pink candies than the other colors. This means the probability of getting a pink candy is now less than 25%. 

Therefore, it is less likely for Peter to get a pink candy than it was for Megan.

Answer: [D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

\section{M032507}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector and then apply that probability to the total number of spins.

1. First, we count the number of sectors on the spinner. There are 5 sectors in total (Orange, Green, Blue, Red, Purple).

2. Since the spinner appears to be divided into equal parts, each sector has an equal chance of being landed on. Therefore, the probability of landing on any one sector, including the red sector, is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

3. To find out how many times the spinner is expected to land on the red sector out of 600 spins, we multiply the total number of spins by the probability of landing on the red sector:

\[ 600 \times \frac{1}{5} = 600 \times 0.2 = 120 \]

However, 120 is not one of the options provided, which suggests there might be an error in the interpretation of the image or the options given. Since we can't visually confirm the exact proportions of the spinner sectors, we have to make an educated guess based on the options provided.

Given the options, the closest to 120 is:

Answer: [D] 60

It seems there might be a discrepancy, as the correct mathematical answer based on the equal sectors should be 120, but since that's not an option, we choose the closest one.

\section{M032681A}
To determine by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced according to the solid line on the graph, you should:

1. Locate the point on the vertical axis that corresponds to 150 cars produced.
2. Move horizontally across from that point until you meet the solid line that represents the actual car production.
3. From the point where you meet the solid line, move vertically down to the horizontal axis to find the corresponding time.

Following these steps, it looks like the solid line crosses the 150-car mark shortly after 11 am. There are no exact time markings between 11 am and 12 noon, but it appears to be around a third of the way between these two hours. Since each hour is divided into 60 minutes, a third of an hour would be approximately 20 minutes. Therefore, it would be around 11:20 am when the production hit 150 cars.

Answer: Approximately 11:20 am.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
To find the average number of cars produced per hour on this day by the NU Car Motor Company, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, which represents the actual car production.

First, we need to determine the total number of cars produced by the end of the day. At 4 pm, the graph shows that the total number of cars produced is just under 400. Since the exact number is not clear and we don't have the precise data, we can estimate the number to be around 390 to 395 cars. For the purpose of this calculation, let's assume the total number produced is 390 cars.

Next, we need to calculate the total time period over which these cars were produced. The graph starts at 8 am and ends at 4 pm, which is a total of 8 hours.

Now we can calculate the average number of cars produced per hour by dividing the total number of cars produced by the total number of hours:

Average number of cars produced per hour = Total number of cars produced / Total number of hours
Average number of cars produced per hour = 390 cars / 8 hours

Now we perform the division:

Average number of cars produced per hour = 48.75 cars/hour

Since we can't produce a fraction of a car, we can round this number to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, for the purpose of this calculation, the average number of cars produced per hour on this day is approximately 48.75. 

Answer: [48.75 cars per hour]

\section{M032681C}
To determine during which hour the most cars were produced by the NU Car Motor Company, we should look for the hour where the solid line has the steepest slope, or the greatest increase in height from one hour to the next.

By examining the graph, we can see that the solid line shows a significant increase between 2 pm and 3 pm, which is steeper than any other hour-to-hour segment on the graph. This indicates that the most cars were produced during the hour between 2 pm and 3 pm.

[Between 2 pm and 3 pm]

\section{M032695}
To create a pie chart, we need to calculate the percentage of the total that each group represents and then convert these percentages into angles for the pie chart since a circle has 360 degrees.

1. University: \( \frac{50}{400} \times 100\% = 12.5\% \)
2. Polytechnic: \( \frac{100}{400} \times 100\% = 25\% \)
3. Business College: \( \frac{150}{400} \times 100\% = 37.5\% \)
4. Workforce: The remainder is \( 400 - (50 + 100 + 150) = 100 \) students, so \( \frac{100}{400} \times 100\% = 25\% \)

Now we convert these percentages to degrees:
1. University: \( 12.5\% \times 360° = 45° \)
2. Polytechnic: \( 25\% \times 360° = 90° \)
3. Business College: \( 37.5\% \times 360° = 135° \)
4. Workforce: \( 25\% \times 360° = 90° \)

To draw the pie chart, we would:
1. Draw a line from the center to the edge of the circle to start the first sector.
2. Measure the angle for the University sector (45°) from that line and draw another line to create the sector.
3. From the end of the University sector, measure the angle for the Polytechnic sector (90°) and draw another line.
4. Repeat the process for the Business College sector (135°).
5. The remaining sector will be for the Workforce, which should also be 90°.

Label each sector with the name of the corresponding group. Since I cannot draw on the image, I've described the steps you would take to create the pie chart.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to estimate the rate of change in sales for each type of soft drink and then project when the sales of Cherry Cola will equal the sales of Lemon Cola.

From the graph, we can see that the sales of Lemon Cola are decreasing each year, while the sales of Cherry Cola are increasing. We need to estimate the yearly change in sales for each drink.

For Lemon Cola:
- From 1998 to 1999, sales decreased by about 10 million cans (from 60 to 50 million).
- From 1999 to 2000, sales decreased by about 10 million cans (from 50 to 40 million).
- From 2000 to 2001, sales decreased by about 10 million cans (from 40 to 30 million).

It seems that Lemon Cola sales are decreasing by approximately 10 million cans per year.

For Cherry Cola:
- From 1998 to 1999, sales increased by about 10 million cans (from 10 to 20 million).
- From 1999 to 2000, sales increased by about 10 million cans (from 20 to 30 million).
- From 2000 to 2001, sales increased by about 10 million cans (from 30 to 40 million).

Cherry Cola sales are increasing by approximately 10 million cans per year.

Since both are changing by 10 million cans per year in opposite directions, the difference in sales between the two drinks is closing by 20 million cans each year. In 2001, the difference is 10 million cans (40 million for Lemon Cola and 30 million for Cherry Cola). Therefore, if the trends continue, the sales will be the same in the next year, 2002.

However, 2002 is not an option in the multiple-choice answers provided. This suggests that there may be an error in the question or the options given. Given the options, the closest year after 2001 is 2003.

2. Divide the total number of staff by the number of restaurants.

Let's do the calculation:

Step 1: Add up the number of staff members.
$12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30 = 100$

To find the median, you need to arrange the numbers in ascending or descending order and then find the middle value. 

The numbers given are: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30. 

Arranged in ascending order, they are: 12, 18, 19, 21, 30.

Since there is an odd number of restaurants (5), the median will be the middle number, which is the third number in the ordered list.

So, the median number of staff members is the number associated with the third restaurant.

Answer: [19]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042169C}
Type of question: Free text response

First, let's analyze the initial situation:

The number of staff members in each of the 5 restaurants are: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30.

To find the median, we arrange the numbers in ascending order (which they already are) and find the middle number. With five numbers, the median is the third number:

12, 18, 19, 21, 30

The median is 19.

To find the mean, we add up all the numbers and divide by the total count:

(12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20

The mean is 20.

Now, let's consider the changes after the restaurant with 30 staff members increases its number to 50:

The new set of numbers will be: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 50.

The median will still be the third number in the list, which remains 19. Therefore, the median does not change.

To find the new mean, we add up the new numbers and divide by 5:

(12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

The new mean is 24.

So, increasing the number of staff members in the last restaurant from 30 to 50 does not affect the median but increases the mean from 20 to 24.

Answer: The median remains the same at 19, and the mean increases from 20 to 24.

1. Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: $50\% = \frac{50}{100} = 0.5$.

2. Multiply the total number of bottles by the decimal to find the number of regular size bottles: $0.5 \times 1,200 = 600$.

\section{M042179}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing either a blue button or a white button from the bag. The total number of buttons in the bag is the sum of red, blue, and white buttons, which is 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 buttons.

The number of favorable outcomes for drawing a blue button is 8, and for drawing a white button is 4. Since these are mutually exclusive events (a button cannot be both blue and white), we can add the number of favorable outcomes for each event to find the total number of favorable outcomes for drawing either a blue or white button, which is 8 + 4 = 12.

The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of drawing either a blue or white button is 12 (favorable outcomes) divided by 22 (total outcomes).

\section{M042207}
The question involves a drawing task, where we need to complete and label a pie chart based on the data provided. Here's how to approach this task:

1. Calculate the total number of students surveyed. According to the table, there are 480 students in total.

2. Determine the percentage of students that favor each sport. To do this, divide the number of students that favor each sport by the total number of students, and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

   - Hockey: \( \frac{60}{480} \times 100 = 12.5\% \)
   - Football: \( \frac{180}{480} \times 100 = 37.5\% \)
   - Tennis: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100 = 25\% \)
   - Basketball: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100 = 25\% \)

3. Convert these percentages into degrees for the pie chart, because a full circle is 360 degrees. Each percentage point will be equivalent to 3.6 degrees (since \( 360 \div 100 = 3.6 \)).

   - Hockey: \( 12.5\% \times 3.6 = 45 \) degrees
   - Football: \( 37.5\% \times 3.6 = 135 \) degrees
   - Tennis: \( 25\% \times 3.6 = 90 \) degrees
   - Basketball: \( 25\% \times 3.6 = 90 \) degrees

4. Draw the segments on the pie chart using the calculated degrees. It might help to start from the top (12 o'clock position) and work clockwise, or in the order of the sports listed.

5. Label each segment with the name of the sport and the corresponding percentage or number of students.

Without the ability to update the image, I can provide a description of what the labeled pie chart should look like:

- The Hockey segment should cover 45 degrees of the circle, which is an eighth of the pie chart.
- The Football segment should cover 135 degrees, which is three-eighths of the pie chart.
- The Tennis and Basketball segments should each cover 90 degrees, which is a quarter of the pie chart.

Each segment should be labeled appropriately with the sport's name and either the percentage or the number of students who favor that sport.

To answer this question, we need to understand what the percentages represent in the context of the election results. 

Pat received 80% of the votes, which means that out of every 100 students, 80 voted for Pat. Chris received 20% of the votes, which means 20 out of every 100 students voted for Chris.

If we were to ask a student at random about their vote, the likelihood of them having voted for Pat is represented by the percentage of votes Pat received. Since Pat received a large majority of the votes (80%), it is more likely than not that a randomly selected student voted for Pat.

Answer: [B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine which statement must be true based on the given information, let's analyze each option:

[A] This statement cannot be confirmed as true just based on the average lengths. Even if Team B's average is higher, it doesn't necessarily mean that each individual on Team B outperformed each individual on Team A.

[B] This statement is similar to [A] and also cannot be confirmed as true based on the averages alone. It's possible that some students in team A jumped farther than some students in team B, but the overall average for Team B was higher due to other factors.

[C] This statement is true because the average jump length for Team B is higher than that of Team A. Since there were the same number of students in each team, the total distance jumped by Team B as a group would be greater than that of Team A.

[D] This statement could be true, but it is not guaranteed based on the information given. We only have the average lengths, and without knowing the individual results, we cannot confirm that some students in Team A jumped farther than some in Team B.

Answer: [C] As a group, team B jumped farther than team A.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand that since Sue puts the marble back into the bag, the second draw is independent of the first draw. This means that the probability of drawing a red marble the second time is the same as the probability of drawing a red marble the first time.

There are 5 red marbles out of a total of 10 marbles. So the probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles.

The probability P of drawing a red marble is therefore:

\[ P = \frac{\text{number of red marbles}}{\text{total number of marbles}} \]

\[ P = \frac{5}{10} \]

\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \]

Answer: [A] $\frac{1}{2}$

The age structure of a country can have a significant impact on its population growth. In the graphs provided, we can analyze the population distribution of Country X and Country Y to understand why Country X might experience more rapid population growth.

In Country X, the age structure shows a larger base, indicating a higher percentage of the population in the youngest age group (ages 0-19), which is labeled as "Going to have children." This suggests that there is a large number of young individuals who will reach reproductive age in the near future, leading to a potential increase in birth rates as these individuals have children. The shape of the population pyramid for Country X is broad at the base and tapers off towards the top, which is characteristic of populations that are growing rapidly.

On the other hand, Country Y's age structure is more uniform across the different age groups, with a smaller base compared to Country X. This indicates a smaller proportion of the population in the youngest age group. The more even distribution across age groups in Country Y suggests that there are fewer young individuals entering reproductive age, which may lead to a slower growth rate compared to Country X.

In summary, the broader base of the age structure in Country X implies a larger pool of potential parents in the near future, hence leading to more rapid population growth than the more evenly distributed age structure of Country Y.

The image shows two population pyramids comparing the age structure between Country X and Country Y. Population pyramids are graphical illustrations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population, typically broken down by gender. The shape of a population pyramid can give insights into the population growth trends of a country.

From the image, Country X has a broad base and a narrow top, indicating a large proportion of young people and a small proportion of elderly. This is often associated with rapid population growth, as there are many individuals in the reproductive age groups who are likely to have children.

In contrast, Country Y has a narrower base and a wider top, indicating a smaller proportion of young people and a larger proportion of elderly. This is often associated with slow population growth or even population decline, as there are fewer individuals in the reproductive age groups to have children.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X because:

1. The proportion of elderly individuals (ages 45-89) in Country Y is larger relative to the rest of the population compared to Country X. This suggests that a smaller working-age population will have to support a relatively larger elderly population.

2. The smaller base of the pyramid for Country Y indicates that there are fewer young people entering the workforce. This could lead to a strain on the labor market and economic resources, making it more challenging to provide for the needs of the elderly.

3. With fewer young people and a larger elderly population, Country Y might face challenges in maintaining a sustainable ratio of workers to retirees, potentially leading to increased financial pressures on social security systems and healthcare services.

In conclusion, the demographic structure of Country Y suggests an aging population with a higher dependency ratio, which often results in greater challenges in caring for the elderly, both economically and socially.
