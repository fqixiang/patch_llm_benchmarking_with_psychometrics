$\frac{3}{10}$ of $50 = 3 \times 5 = 15$
$50 \%$ of $3 = 0.5 \times 3 = 1.5$
15 is not equal to 1.5, so [A] is not true.
- [B] $3 \%$ of $50=6 \%$ of 100
$3 \%$ of $50 = 0.03 \times 50 = 1.5$
$6 \%$ of $100 = 0.06 \times 100 = 6$
1.5 is not equal to 6, so [B] is not true.
- [C] $50 \div 30=30 \div 50$
$50 \div 30 = \frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3}$
$30 \div 50 = \frac{30}{50} = \frac{3}{5}$
$\frac{5}{3}$ is not equal to $\frac{3}{5}$, so [C] is not true.
- [D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$
$\frac{3}{10} \times 50 = 3 \times 5 = 15$

-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760A}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the relationship between the number of black tiles and the total number of tiles. From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles is 1, 4, 9, ..., which is the square of the row number. So, for the shape with a total of 64 tiles, the number of black tiles is 8^2=64.
Next, we need to find out the relationship between the number of red tiles and the total number of tiles. From the table, we can see that the number of red tiles is 8, 12, 16, ..., which is 7 more than the number of black tiles. So, for the shape with a total of 64 tiles, the number of red tiles is 64-64=56.
3. Therefore, the answer is (D) 64 black tiles and 56 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.


2. The number of black tiles used in the shape is 49. 
The number of red tiles used in the shape is equal to 4 times the number of black tiles used in the shape. 
So, the number of red tiles used in the shape is 4 * 49 = 196.


3. Answer: 196
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.


2. First, let's find out the number of tiles in each shape.

The $3 \times 3$ shape has 1 black tile and 8 red tiles, so it has a total of 1 + 8 = 9 tiles.

The $4 \times 4$ shape has 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles, so it has a total of 4 + 12 = 16 tiles.

The $5 \times 5$ shape has 9 black tiles and 16 red tiles, so it has a total of 9 + 16 = 25 tiles.


We can see that the number of tiles in each shape is increasing by 7. So, the next shape will have 25 + 7 = 32 tiles.

Since the number of black tiles in each shape is 1, 4, 9, we can see that the number of black tiles is increasing by 3 each time. So, the next shape will have 9 + 3 = 12 black tiles.

Therefore, Pat would need 12 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. The question is a free-text response.

2. The pattern is that the number of black tiles is equal to the square of the size of the shape minus 2, and the number of red tiles is equal to the size of the shape squared. So, for a shape that is n x n, the number of black tiles will be (n-2)^2 and the number of red tiles will be n^2.

3. The answer is (n-2)^2 for the number of black tiles, and n^2 for the number of red tiles.

 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula: $$V = lwh$$ where \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height of the box. In this case, we are given the volume of the box, which is $200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, and the height of the box, which is \(4 \mathrm{~cm}\). We need to find the length of the box, which is \(x\).
3. We can rearrange the formula for the volume of a rectangular box to solve for the length: $$x = \frac{V}{wh}$$ Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: $$x = \frac{200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}{(4 \mathrm{~cm})(5 \mathrm{~cm})} = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$$
4. Therefore, the answer is (D) 10 cm.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042270}
 1. The question is asking you to draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm.
2. An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal sides. The base is the side that is not equal to the other two sides. The height is the distance from the base to the highest point of the triangle.
3. To draw the triangle, you will need to use a ruler to measure the base and height. You will also need to use a protractor to measure the angles of the triangle. The base angles should be 45 degrees each, and the top angle should be 90 degrees.
4. Once you have measured the base, height, and angles, you can begin to draw the triangle. Start by drawing the base. Then, use the protractor to measure the angles and draw the two equal sides. Finally, connect the two equal sides to the base to form the triangle.
5. The final step is to check your work. Make sure that the base is 4 cm long, the height is 5 cm, and the angles are correct. If everything is correct, then you have successfully drawn an isosceles triangle.

\section{M042300Z}
 1. To mark the points $B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)$ and $C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)$ on the graph, we first find the point on the graph that is 3 units away from the origin. We do this by moving 3 units along the line from the origin that makes an angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the baseline. This point is the point $B$.

We then find the point on the graph that is 4 units away from the origin. We do this by moving 4 units along the line from the origin that makes an angle of $120^{\circ}$ with the baseline. This point is the point $C$.


2. To draw the angle $B O C$, we first draw a line from the origin to the point $B$. We then draw a line from the origin to the point $C$. The angle between these two lines is the angle $B O C$.

To measure the angle $B O C$, we use a protractor. We place the protractor so that the center of the protractor is at the origin and the baseline of the protractor is aligned with the line $O A$. We then measure the angle between the line $O B$ and the line $O C$. This angle is the angle $B O C$.

The angle $B O C$ is $90^{\circ}$.

\section{M052206}
 1. Type of question: This is a free text response question.
2. Thought process and reasoning: To find the largest number of books that will fit inside the box, we need to find the volume of the box and the volume of each book, and then divide the volume of the box by the volume of each book. The volume of the box is 30 cm x 36 cm x 20 cm = 21600 cm^3. The volume of each book is 20 cm x 15 cm x 6 cm = 1800 cm^3. So the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 21600 cm^3 / 1800 cm^3 = 12 books.
3. Answer: 12.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052362}
 1. The question is a free text response question.


2. Let $AB=2x$, $CX=x$, and $BC=y$.

By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AC^2=AB^2+BC^2$. Substituting the given information, we get $y^2=(2x)^2+x^2=5x^2$. Therefore, $y=\sqrt{5}x$.

Since $AC=BC$, we have $y=x$. Therefore, $\sqrt{5}x=x$, which implies that $x=0$ or $x=\sqrt{5}$.

If $x=0$, then $AB=0$ and $BC=0$. This is impossible because a triangle cannot have two sides of length 0.

Therefore, $x=\sqrt{5}$. Substituting this value back into the Pythagorean theorem, we get $y^2=(\sqrt{5})^2+(\sqrt{5})^2=10$. Therefore, $y=\sqrt{10}$.

Finally, we can use the cosine function to find the size of angle $B$. We have $\cos B=\frac{BC}{AB}=\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2\sqrt{5}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$. Therefore, angle $B$ is approximately $68.2$ degrees.


3. Answer: The size of angle $B$ is approximately 68.2 degrees.

\section{M032402}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the triangle is a right angle triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is 5 cm, and the other two sides are 3 cm and 4 cm. If the Pythagorean theorem holds, then the triangle is a right angle triangle.
3. Let's calculate the squares of the three sides:
- Hypotenuse: $5^2 = 25$
- Side $PQ: 3^2 = 9$
- Side $QR: 4^2 = 16$
4. Now, let's check if the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied:
- $25 = 9 + 16$
- $25 = 25$

Since the Pythagorean theorem holds, the triangle is a right angle triangle.
5. Therefore, the answer is [A].
