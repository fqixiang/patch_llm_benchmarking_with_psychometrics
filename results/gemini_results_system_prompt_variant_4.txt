\section{M032760A}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.


2. The table shows the number of black tiles and red tiles for the first three shapes Pat made. We can see that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape, and the number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape. So, for the shape with a total of 64 tiles, we can guess that there are 16 black tiles and 48 red tiles.


3. Answer: 16 black tiles and 48 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.


2. The number of black tiles and red tiles in the shapes Pat made follows a pattern. 
In the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles. 
In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles. 
In the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles and 16 red tiles.

The number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape. The number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape.

If Pat made a shape that used 49 black tiles, we can work backward to find the number of red tiles.

49 - 3 = 46. So, there are 46 black tiles in the 7 x 7 shape.

16 + 4 = 20. So, there are 20 red tiles in the 4 x 4 shape.


3. Answer: 70
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the relationship between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles is always one less than the number of red tiles. For example, for the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles, and 8 is one more than 1. For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles, and 12 is one more than 4. So, for the shape with 44 red tiles, there should be 43 black tiles.
3. The answer is [D].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. The question type is free text response.
2. First, let's analyze the given information. We know that for the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles, and for the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles. We can see that the number of black tiles is increasing by 3 for each shape, and the number of red tiles is increasing by 4 for each shape.
3. To find the number of tiles needed to make a square of any size, we need to find the pattern for the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. For the number of black tiles, we can see that the pattern is $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \dots$ This is a sequence of squares of consecutive natural numbers, starting from 1. For the number of red tiles, we can see that the pattern is $8, 12, 16, 20, 24, \dots$ This is a sequence of differences of consecutive squares of natural numbers, starting from 8.
4. Therefore, the number of black tiles for the $n \times n$ shape is $(n-2)^2$, and the number of red tiles for the $n \times n$ shape is the difference between the squares of the consecutive natural numbers $n$ and $n-1$, which is $n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 2n-1$. 
5. Therefore, the total number of tiles for the $n \times n$ shape is $(n-2)^2 + (2n-1) = n^2 - 4n + 5$.
6. So, the answer is $n^2 - 4n + 5$.

2. Thought process and reasoning: 
- The area of a square is given by $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of one side of the square.
- We are given that the area of the square is $144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so we can solve for $s$:
$$144 = s^2$$
$$s = 12 \mathrm{~cm}$$
- The perimeter of a square is given by $P = 4s$, where $s$ is the length of one side of the square.
- We know that $s = 12 \mathrm{~cm}$, so we can calculate the perimeter:
$$P = 4s = 4(12 \mathrm{~cm}) = 48 \mathrm{~cm}$$

\section{M032397}
 1. Type of question: Multiple choice.

2. First, let's analyze the changes from Figure 1 to Figure 2. The triangle in Figure 2 is a reflection of the triangle in Figure 1 across the y-axis. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choices [C] and [D] because they do not include a reflection.

3. Next, let's analyze the changes from Figure 2 to Figure 3. The triangle in Figure 3 is a translation of the triangle in Figure 2 down by 2 units. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice [B] because it does not include a translation.

5. Answer: [A]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032398}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the angle on the left is 45 degrees, and the angle on the right is 30 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we know that the angle at the top must be 105 degrees. Since the angle at the top is 105 degrees, and the angle on the left is 45 degrees, the angle x must be 60 degrees.
3. The answer is [D] 65 degrees.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032402}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.


2. To determine whether a triangle is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the sides of the triangle are 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. We can calculate the squares of the sides as follows:

3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
5^2 = 25

We can then check if the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied:

9 + 16 = 25

Since the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied, we can conclude that the triangle is a right-angled triangle.


3. The answer is [A].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032623}
 1. This is a multiple-choice question.
2. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. The base of the triangle is 8 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $A = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 = 24 \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The area of the rectangle is given by the formula \(A = l\times w\), where \(l\) is the length and \(w\) is the width. The length of the rectangle is 16 cm, and the width is 6 cm. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \(A = 16 \times 6 = 96 \mathrm{cm}^{2}\). The area of the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle, or \(96 \mathrm{cm}^{2} - 24 \mathrm{cm}^{2} = 72 \mathrm{cm}^{2}\).

\section{M032734}
 1. Type of question: Drawing.

2. First, imagine folding the left triangle flap up along the dotted line. It will touch the edge of the flap next to it. Now imagine folding the right triangle flap up along the dotted line. It will also touch the edge of the flap next to it. The two flaps will meet in the middle, and the shape will be symmetrical.

3. To complete the drawing, we need to draw the two triangle flaps in their new positions. The left flap will be a triangle with a right angle at the top and two angles of 45 degrees at the bottom. The right flap will be a triangle with a right angle at the top and two angles of 45 degrees at the bottom. The two flaps will meet in the middle, and the shape will be symmetrical.

4. Answer: The completed drawing will be a square.

\section{M042150}
 1. The question is asking which shape has a line of symmetry. A line of symmetry is a line that divides a shape into two mirror images.
2. I would first look at each shape and see if I can identify any lines of symmetry. A line of symmetry must pass through the center of the shape. For example, shape A has no line of symmetry because there is no line that can divide the shape into two mirror images. Shape B has one line of symmetry, which is the line that passes through the vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. Shape C has two lines of symmetry, which are the diagonals of the shape. Shape D has no lines of symmetry.
3. The answer is C.

 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula: \(V = lwh\), where \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height. In this question, we are given the volume of the box \(V = 200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), the width \(w = 4 \mathrm{~cm}\), and the height \(h = 5 \mathrm{~cm}\). We are asked to find the length \(l\).
3. We can find the length \(l\) by rearranging the formula for the volume of a rectangular box: $$l = \frac{V}{wh}$$Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: $$l = \frac{200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}{(4 \mathrm{~cm})(5 \mathrm{~cm})} = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$$
4. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is 10 cm. The answer key is [D].

\section{M052084}
1. Type of question: Multiple choice.
2. Thought process:
- The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.
- Since the perimeter is $36 \mathrm{~cm}$, each side must be $36 \mathrm{~cm} / 4 = 9 \mathrm{~cm}$.
- The area of a square is the square of the length of one side.
- Therefore, the area of this square is $9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
3. Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052206}
 1. This is a free-text response question.
2. The volume of the box is 30 * 36 * 20 = 21600 cm^3. The volume of a book is 20 * 15 * 6 = 1800 cm^3. So the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 21600 / 1800 = 12.
3. 12
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052362}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.
2. We know that $A C=B C$ and $A B$ is twice as long as $C X$. Let $A B=2x$ and $C X=x$. Then, we have a right triangle with sides $A B=2x$, $B C=x$, and $A C=\sqrt{(2x)^2+x^2}=\sqrt{5x^2}$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $$\sqrt{5x^2}=2x$$ Squaring both sides, we get $$5x^2=4x^2$$ Subtracting $4x^2$ from both sides, we get $$x^2=0$$ Taking the square root of both sides, we get $$x=0$$ This means that $A B=2x=0$ and $C X=x=0$. This is impossible, since the sides of a triangle cannot be zero. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.
3. The answer is "No solution".
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052408}
 1. Type of question: Free text response.

2. Thought process and reasoning: Since lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel, the angles on one side of the transversal are supplementary to the angles on the other side of the transversal. Therefore, the angle on the left side of the transversal that is supplementary to the 60-degree angle is 120 degrees. The angle on the right side of the transversal that is supplementary to the 70-degree angle is also 120 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so the missing angle in the triangle is 180 - 70 - 120 = -10 degrees. However, angles cannot be negative, so the angle must be 10 degrees. Therefore, the value of b is 10.

3. Answer: 10 degrees.
