\section{M052173}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. The answer is [D].

The area of the shaded portion of the garden is equal to the area of the rectangle with dimensions \(x\) meters by \((x+4)\) meters, minus the area of the rectangle with dimensions \((x-1)\) meters by \(1\) meter.

$$A = x(x+4) - (x-1)(1)$$

$$A = x^2 + 4x - x + 1$$

$$A = x^2 + 3x + 1$$

\section{M042300Z}
 1. Type of question: Drawing

2. Answer: 
- Mark the points \(B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)\) and \(C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)\) on the graph above.

To mark the point \(B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)\), we first find the point on the circle that is 3 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin through this point. The angle between this line and the baseline is 30 degrees.

To mark the point \(C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)\), we first find the point on the circle that is 4 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin through this point. The angle between this line and the baseline is 120 degrees.

- Draw the angle \(B O C\). What is the measure of angle \(B O C\)?

To draw the angle \(B O C\), we connect the points \(B\) and \(C\). The measure of angle \(B O C\) is the difference between the angles of \(B\) and \(C\). That is,

$$m\angle B O C = 120^\circ - 30^\circ = 90^\circ$$

Therefore, the measure of angle \(B O C\) is 90 degrees.

\section{M032681B}
 1. Type of question: Free text response.
2. Answer: 168.75.

The average number of cars produced per hour on this day is 168.75. To find this, we can use the formula:

```
average speed = (total distance traveled) / (total time)
```

In this case, the total distance traveled is the total number of cars produced, which is 400. The total time is the number of hours the factory was open, which is 8 hours (from 8am to 4pm). So, the average number of cars produced per hour is:

```
average speed = 400 cars / 8 hours = 50 cars per hour
```

2. Country Y will have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X because it has a higher percentage of elderly people. The bulge in the graph for Country Y in the 20-40 year-old cohort will become the bulge in the 60-80 year-old cohort in the future. Country X, on the other hand, has a smaller percentage of elderly people and a larger percentage of young people. This means that there will be fewer people of working age to support the elderly population in Country Y than in Country X.
