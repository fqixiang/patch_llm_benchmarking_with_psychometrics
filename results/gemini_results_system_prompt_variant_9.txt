-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. This is a free-text response question.


2. Let's think step-by-step. First, let's look at the pattern in the table. We can see that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape, starting with 1. The number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape, starting with 8.


3. So, for the shape $n \times n$, the number of black tiles will be $(n-2)^{2}$, since we have (n-2) black tiles on each side. The number of red tiles will be $4n-4$, since we have 4 red tiles on each side and we remove 4 corner tiles.


4. Therefore, the total number of tiles will be $(n-2)^{2} + 4n-4$.


5. So, the answer is: $(n-2)^{2} + 4n-4$.

2. Thought process: 
- The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts.
- The distance between two points is the length of the line segment connecting the two points.
- To find the distance between the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$, we need to find the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$ first.
- The midpoint of $AB$ is the point that divides $AB$ into two equal parts, so it is located at a distance of $AB/2 = 10 \mathrm{~cm} / 2 = 5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from $A$.
- The midpoint of $BC$ is the point that divides $BC$ into two equal parts, so it is located at a distance of $BC/2 = 5.2 \mathrm{~cm} / 2 = 2.6 \mathrm{~cm}$ from $B$.
- The distance between the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$ is the length of the line segment connecting the two midpoints, so it is equal to $5 \mathrm{~cm} - 2.6 \mathrm{~cm} = 2.4 \mathrm{~cm}$.

\section{M032402}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. To determine whether a triangle is a right angle triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the sides of the triangle are 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. We can calculate the squares of the sides as follows:
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
5^2 = 25
We can then check if the Pythagorean theorem holds:
9 + 16 = 25
Since 9 + 16 = 25, the Pythagorean theorem holds and therefore the triangle is a right angle triangle.

3. Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052206}
 1. Type of question: multiple choice.
2. First, let's find the volume of the box. The formula for the volume of a rectangular box is:

```
V = lwh
```

where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

In this case, the length is 36 cm, the width is 20 cm, and the height is 30 cm. So, the volume of the box is:

```
V = 36 cm * 20 cm * 30 cm = 21,600 cm^3
```

Next, let's find the volume of a single book. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

```
V = lwh
```

where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

In this case, the length is 15 cm, the width is 20 cm, and the height is 6 cm. So, the volume of a single book is:

```
V = 15 cm * 20 cm * 6 cm = 1,800 cm^3
```

Now, we can divide the volume of the box by the volume of a single book to find the largest number of books that will fit inside the box:

```
21,600 cm^3 / 1,800 cm^3 = 12
```

So, the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 12.

\section{M052362}
 1. This is a free-text response question.

2. Since $AC = BC$, we know that $AX =XB$. Let $AX=XB=a$ and $CX=b$. We have $AB=2b$. 

We have a right triangle $AXC$ with $AX=a$ and $XC=b$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AC^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Since $AC = 2a$, we have $4a^2 = a^2 + b^2$, which implies $b^2 = 3a^2$. 

Now we look at triangle $ABC$. We have $AB = 2b$ and $BC = 2a$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$. Substituting $AC = 2a$, $AB = 2b$, and $b^2 = 3a^2$, we have $4a^2 = 4b^2 + 4a^2$, which implies $b^2 = 0$. 

Since $b^2 = 0$, we have $b = 0$. This means that $X$ coincides with $C$. Therefore, angle $B$ is a right angle, which is $90$ degrees.

3. The answer is $90$ degrees.

\section{M052408}
 1. Type of question: Free text response.

2. The question is asking for the value of angle $b$. We can see that angle $a$ is 60 degrees, and angle $c$ is 70 degrees. Since lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel, we know that angle $b$ is supplementary to angle $a$, which means that angle $b$ and angle $a$ add up to 180 degrees. So, angle $b$ is 180 - 60 = 120 degrees.

3. Answer: 120 degrees.
