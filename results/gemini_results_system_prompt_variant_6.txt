\section{M032757}
 1. The question is a free text response question.

2. To determine the number of black and red tiles in the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes, we need to identify the pattern in the number of tiles in the previous shapes.

3. In the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles. In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles. In the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles and 16 red tiles.

4. We can see that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape, starting from 1. The number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape, starting from 8.

5. Using this pattern, we can determine the number of black and red tiles in the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes:

6. For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the number of black tiles is 16 + 3 = 19. The number of red tiles is 20 + 4 = 24.

7. For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the number of black tiles is 25 + 3 = 28. The number of red tiles is 28 + 4 = 32.

-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760A}
 1. This is a free-text response question.
2. The table shows that the number of black tiles is the square of the side length, and the number of red tiles is twice the square of the side length. So for a shape with a total of 64 tiles, the side length must be 8 because \(8^2 + 2(8^2) = 64\). Therefore, there are 64 red tiles and 8 black tiles.
3. 8 black tiles and 56 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
 1. This is a multiple-choice question.
2. Let's think step by step. The table shows that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape. So, the number of black tiles in the shape that Pat made is 49 - 3 = 46. The table also shows that the number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape. So, the number of red tiles in the shape that Pat made is 16 + 4 = 20.
3. The answer is (C).
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. First, let's find out the relationship between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles is equal to the square of the side length of the square. For example, for the 3x3 shape, the number of black tiles is 3^2 = 9.
3. Next, let's find out the total number of tiles in a square. From the table, we can see that the total number of tiles is equal to the sum of the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. For example, for the 3x3 shape, the total number of tiles is 9 + 8 = 17.
4. Now, let's use these relationships to find out how many black tiles Pat would need to complete the black part of the shape. We know that Pat is using 44 red tiles. So, the total number of tiles in the shape will be 44 + the number of black tiles. We also know that the total number of tiles is equal to the sum of the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. So, we can write an equation:
```
Total number of tiles = Number of black tiles + Number of red tiles
```
```
44 + Number of black tiles = 44 + 44
```
```
Number of black tiles = 44
```
Therefore, Pat would need 44 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.
5. The answer is [D].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.

2. We can see that the number of black tiles is increasing by 2 for each shape. The number of red tiles is increasing by 4 for each shape. The total number of tiles is increasing by 6 for each shape.

3. So, for shape $n \times n$, the number of black tiles will be $(n-2)^2$, the number of red tiles will be $4n-4$, and the total number of tiles will be $5n-4$.

4. Therefore, the answer is $(n-2)^2$.

\section{M032398}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the angle on the left side of the triangle is 45 degrees and the angle on the right side is 30 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we know that the angle at the top of the triangle must be 105 degrees. Since the angle at the top is 105 degrees, the angle below it must be 75 degrees. The final answer is 75 degrees.

\section{M032402}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. To determine whether a triangle is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the sides of the triangle are 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. We can calculate the squares of the sides as follows:
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
5^2 = 25
We can then check if the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied:
9 + 16 = 25
Since 9 + 16 = 25, the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied and therefore the triangle is a right-angled triangle.
3. The answer is [A].

\section{M042300Z}
 1. To mark the point $B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)$, we first find the point on the graph that is 3 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin that makes an angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the baseline. The point where the line intersects the circle is the point $B$.

To mark the point $C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)$, we first find the point on the graph that is 4 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin that makes an angle of $120^{\circ}$ with the baseline. The point where the line intersects the circle is the point $C$.


2. To draw the angle $B O C$, we first draw a line from the point $B$ to the origin. We then draw a line from the origin to the point $C$. The angle between these two lines is the angle $B O C$.

To measure the angle $B O C$, we can use a protractor. We place the protractor at the origin and align the zero-degree mark with the line $O A$. We then find the point on the protractor that corresponds to the line $O C$. The angle between the zero-degree mark and the point on the protractor that corresponds to the line $O C$ is the measure of the angle $B O C$.

The measure of angle $B O C$ is $90^{\circ}$.

\section{M052362}
 1. This is a free text response question.
2. Since $AC = BC$, we know that $AX = XB$. Let $AX = XB = a$. We also know that $AB = 2CX$. Let $CX = b$. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $c$ is the length of $AB$. Substituting $b = 2a$ into this equation, we get $a^2 + (2a)^2 = c^2$. Solving for $c$, we get $c = \sqrt{5}a$. Finally, we can use the cosine rule to find the size of angle $B$. The cosine rule states that $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos{C}$. In this case, $C$ is a right angle, so $\cos{C} = 0$. Therefore, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Substituting $a = \sqrt{5}a$ and $b = 2a$ into this equation, we get $5a^2 = 5a^2$. This implies that $\cos{B} = 1$, which means that angle $B$ is $60^\circ$.
