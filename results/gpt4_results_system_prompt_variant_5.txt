Step by step reasoning:
1. First, we need to determine how much money Jenny gets. Since Jenny gets $\frac{3}{8}$ of the total amount, we can calculate this by multiplying the total amount ($560$ zeds) by $\frac{3}{8}$.
2. To find out how many zeds Ann gets, we need to subtract the amount Jenny gets from the total amount. 

Calculation:
1. Jenny's amount: $\frac{3}{8} \times 560$ zeds.
2. Simplify the fraction multiplication by dividing the total amount by the denominator of the fraction and then multiplying by the numerator:
\[ \frac{560}{8} = 70 \]
\[ 70 \times 3 = 210 \]
So, Jenny gets $210$ zeds.
3. Ann's amount: Total amount - Jenny's amount.
\[ 560 - 210 = 350 \]
So, Ann gets $350$ zeds.

Answer: [Ann gets 350 zeds]

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions together. Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before we can add them. The easiest common denominator to use here is 1000 since 100 is a factor of 1000. 

First, we convert $\frac{4}{100}$ to a fraction with a denominator of 1000 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 10. This gives us $\frac{40}{1000}$. 

Now we can add the two fractions:

$\frac{40}{1000} + \frac{3}{1000} = \frac{40 + 3}{1000} = \frac{43}{1000}$

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

$\frac{43}{1000} = 0.043$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: [A] 0.043

To estimate the value of $\frac{7.21 \times 3.86}{10.09}$, we can round each number to its nearest whole number and then perform the calculation.

Step by step:

1. Round 7.21 to 7 (since it is closer to 7 than to 8).
2. Round 3.86 to 4 (since it is closer to 4 than to 3).
3. Round 10.09 to 10 (since it is closer to 10 than to 11).

Now, we can substitute these rounded numbers into the original expression:

$\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$

This corresponds to option [B].

Answer: [B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$

\section{M032626}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. The prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.

Step by step, we will break down the number 36 into its prime factors:

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if 36 is divisible by 2. It is, because 36 is an even number. So we divide 36 by 2 and get 18.

2. Now we have 18, which is also even, so it is divisible by 2. We divide 18 by 2 and get 9.

3. 9 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3. 9 is divisible by 3. We divide 9 by 3 and get 3.

4. We are left with the number 3, which is a prime number itself.

So, 36 can be expressed as 2 x 2 x 3 x 3, which are all prime numbers.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

Type of question: This is a multiple choice question.

Think step by step, and describe your thought process and reasoning:
- We are given two fractions, P and Q, on a number line between 0 and 1.
- The product of two fractions (P × Q) will result in another fraction, N.
- Since both P and Q are less than 1, their product will also be less than either of them. This is because multiplying two numbers that are each less than 1 will yield a result that is smaller than either of the original numbers.
- Therefore, N must be located to the left of both P and Q on the number line.

Answer:
- For multiple choice: [selected answer key] is C. N is shown to the left of both P and Q on the number line, which is consistent with the rules of multiplying fractions less than 1.

2. Thought process and reasoning:
To write the mixed number $3 \frac{5}{6}$ in decimal form, we first convert the fraction $\frac{5}{6}$ to a decimal. To do this, we divide the numerator (5) by the denominator (6). 

5 divided by 6 gives us 0.8333... Since we need to round to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal place, which is a '3'. Since the third decimal place is less than 5, we do not round up the second decimal place. Therefore, the decimal part remains as 0.83.

Now, we add this decimal to the whole number part of the mixed number, which is 3. 

So, $3 + 0.83 = 3.83$.

3. Answer:
\[3.83\]

\section{M042002}
This is a free-text response question where we need to place the given digits into the boxes to create two two-digit numbers that, when multiplied, give the greatest result.

To maximize the product of two numbers with the given digits, we should place the larger digits in the tens place because the tens place contributes more to the overall value of the number than the ones place. Therefore, we should use the two largest digits, 9 and 7, in the tens places.

For the remaining digits, 5 and 3, we should place them in the ones place. To maximize the product, we should pair the larger tens digit with the smaller ones digit and vice versa, to balance the multiplication and get a higher product.

So the largest number we can get by multiplying a combination of these two-digit numbers is by placing 9 and 3 in the first number (making 93) and 7 and 5 in the second number (making 75).

The multiplication would then be:
93 × 75

Answer: [The digits should be placed as follows: 9 and 3 in the top boxes, 7 and 5 in the bottom boxes.]

To solve this problem, we can use the properties of exponents. When multiplying two powers with the same base, we add the exponents. 

From the table, we see that $256$ is equal to $4^{4}$ and $4,096$ is equal to $4^{6}$. 

So, $256 \times 4,096$ is the same as $4^{4} \times 4^{6}$.

Using the properties of exponents, we add the exponents:

$4^{4} \times 4^{6} = 4^{4+6} = 4^{10}$.

Answer: [A] $4^{10}$.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the value of $K$ on the number line, we need to look at the intervals between the marked numbers. The number line shows the numbers 26 and 28, and there are ten intervals between them, which means each interval represents a 0.1 increment since \(28 - 26 = 2\) and \(2 \div 10 = 0.1\).

The mark for $K$ is two intervals to the right of 27. Since each interval represents 0.1, two intervals would represent \(2 \times 0.1 = 0.2\). Therefore, $K$ is 0.2 more than 27.

\section{M042031}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the value of the square that makes the fractions equivalent, we need to find a common factor or a way to relate the denominators 14 and 21. We can do this by finding a number that when multiplied by 14 gives us a product that has a factor of 21.

Step by step:
1. Simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us $\frac{2}{7}$.
2. To find the equivalent fraction with a denominator of 21, we need to determine what number we can multiply 7 by to get 21. That number is 3.
3. Since we multiplied the denominator by 3 to get from 7 to 21, we must also multiply the numerator by 3 to keep the fractions equivalent.
4. Multiplying the numerator 2 by 3 gives us 6.
5. Therefore, the fraction equivalent to $\frac{4}{14}$ with a denominator of 21 is $\frac{6}{21}$.

Answer: [A] 6

\section{M042032}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the fraction equivalent to 0.125, we need to express 0.125 as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator. Since 0.125 has three decimal places, we can write it as a fraction with a denominator of 1000 (because 1/1000 equals 0.001, which is the value of the third decimal place).

So, 0.125 is equivalent to 125/1000. However, we should simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. In this case, 125 and 1000 are both divisible by 125.

125 ÷ 125 = 1
1000 ÷ 125 = 8

Therefore, the fraction equivalent to 0.125 is 1/8. But since the options are not simplified, we should match our original fraction 125/1000 to the options given.

Answer: [B] $\frac{125}{1,000}$

\section{M042041}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the original pipe before the workman cut off a piece of it. Since we know that the piece he cut off represents $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original length, we can set up a proportion to find the full length.

Let's denote the original length of the pipe as $L$. The piece cut off, which is 3 meters long, is $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original length. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

$$\frac{1}{5}L = 3 \text{ meters}$$

To find $L$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

$$L = 3 \text{ meters} \times 5$$

$$L = 15 \text{ meters}$$

1. Type of question: This is a free text response question that requires calculating percentages and applying them to the given number of tries.

2. Thought process and reasoning:
- For James, to find the percentage of successful shots, we use the given number of successful shots (15) and divide by the total number of tries (20), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
- For Andrew, to find the number of successful shots, we use the given percentage of successful shots (80%) and apply it to the total number of tries (20) to find the number of successful shots.

3. Answer:
- For James: Percentage of Successful Shots = (Number of Successful Shots / Total Number of Shots) * 100 = (15 / 20) * 100 = 75%
- For Andrew: Number of Successful Shots = (Percentage of Successful Shots / 100) * Total Number of Shots = (80% / 100) * 20 = 0.8 * 20 = 16

So, the completed boxes should be:
- James: 75%

2. Thought process and reasoning:
The given pattern shows a sequence of subtraction operations starting with the number 3 and subtracting a descending sequence of numbers from it (3, 2, 1, 0).

The pattern is as follows:
- In the first line, $3-3=0$, the number 3 is subtracted from itself, giving 0.
- In the second line, $3-2=1$, the number 2 is subtracted from 3, giving 1.
- In the third line, $3-1=2$, the number 1 is subtracted from 3, giving 2.
- In the fourth line, $3-0=3$, the number 0 is subtracted from 3, giving 3.

Following this pattern, the next line should be subtracting the next integer in the descending sequence from 3. Since we've reached 0, the next integer in a descending sequence would be -1 (as it comes after 0 in descending order).

3. Answer:
The next line in the pattern would be:
\[3 - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4\]
So the next line is $3-(-1)=4$.

\section{M052061}
1. This is a free text response question.

2. To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes Kim will need to pack all 94 eggs, given that each box can hold 6 eggs. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each box can hold. This will give us the number of boxes she needs. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a box, if there is a remainder after the division, we will need to round up to the next whole number to ensure that all eggs are packed. This is because Kim will need an additional box for the remaining eggs that do not fit perfectly into the boxes.

3. Let's perform the division:
94 eggs ÷ 6 eggs/box = 15 boxes with a remainder of 4 eggs.

Since there is a remainder, Kim will need one more box to pack the remaining 4 eggs. Therefore, the smallest number of boxes she needs is 15 boxes plus 1 additional box.

Answer: [16 boxes]

Type of question: Multiple choice

Step by step:

[A] To check if $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$ equals $50\%$ of $3$, we calculate both sides. $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$ is $50 \times \frac{3}{10} = 5 \times 3 = 15$. $50\%$ of $3$ is $\frac{50}{100} \times 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 = 1.5$. Since 15 does not equal 1.5, option [A] is not true.

[B] To check if $3\%$ of $50$ equals $6\%$ of $100$, we calculate both sides. $3\%$ of $50$ is $\frac{3}{100} \times 50 = 1.5$. $6\%$ of $100$ is $\frac{6}{100} \times 100 = 6$. Since 1.5 does not equal 6, option [B] is not true.

[C] To check if $50 \div 30$ equals $30 \div 50$, we calculate both sides. $50 \div 30$ is approximately $1.6667$. $30 \div 50$ is $0.6$. Since 1.6667 does not equal 0.6, option [C] is not true.

[D] To check if $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ equals $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$, we calculate both sides. $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ is $5 \times 3 = 15$. $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$ is $3 \times 5 = 15$. Since both sides equal 15, option [D] is true.

\section{M052228}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 4 is their product, which is 12. We then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the denominator of 12.

For $\frac{1}{3}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get $\frac{4}{12}$.
For $\frac{1}{4}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get $\frac{3}{12}$.

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:
$\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4-3}{12}$

This simplifies to $\frac{1}{12}$.

Looking at the options, we can see that option [D] $\frac{4-3}{3 \times 4}$ represents the correct method for finding the difference between $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$, as it shows the numerators being subtracted and the denominators being multiplied to find the common denominator.

- In the hundredths place, we add 4 to 5, which equals 9.
- In the tenths place, we have 7 plus 6, which equals 13. We write down 3 in the tenths place and carry over 1 to the ones place.
- In the ones place, we add 5 plus 2 plus the carried over 1, which equals 8.
- In the tens place, we simply bring down the 4, as there is nothing to add to it.

- Each boy and each girl carried 2 balloons. 
- To find the total number of balloons, we need to add the number of balloons carried by the boys to the number of balloons carried by the girls.
- Since there were $m$ boys, they carried a total of $2m$ balloons (because each boy carried 2 balloons).
- Similarly, since there were $n$ girls, they carried a total of $2n$ balloons.
- To find the total number of balloons, we add the number of balloons carried by the boys and girls together: $2m + 2n$.
- This can be simplified by factoring out the 2, which gives us $2(m + n)$.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to identify the relationship between the height of the bush and the length of its shadow. From the table, we can see that as the height of the bush increases, the shadow length also increases proportionally. We can determine the ratio of the height of the bush to the shadow length by dividing the height by the shadow length for any of the given data points.

Let's take the first data point:
Bush height = 20 cm
Shadow length = 16 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 20 cm / 16 cm = 1.25

Now let's check if this ratio is consistent with the other data points:
For the second data point:
Bush height = 40 cm
Shadow length = 32 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 40 cm / 32 cm = 1.25

For the third data point:
Bush height = 60 cm
Shadow length = 48 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 60 cm / 48 cm = 1.25

For the fourth data point:
Bush height = 80 cm
Shadow length = 64 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 80 cm / 64 cm = 1.25

The ratio is consistent across all data points, which is 1.25. This means that the shadow length is always 1.25 times less than the height of the bush.

Now, we need to find the shadow length for a bush that is 50 cm tall:
Bush height = 50 cm
To find the shadow length, we divide the bush height by the ratio:
Shadow length = Bush height / Ratio = 50 cm / 1.25 = 40 cm

Answer: [C] $40 \mathrm{~cm}$

The expression given is \(2x + 3x\), which simplifies to \(5x\). This indicates that we are looking for a representation that shows 5 parts, each part being of length \(x\).

Now let's analyze the options:

A. The length of this segment shows \(x\) and \(5\), which does not represent \(5x\) since it shows two different lengths, \(x\) and \(5\), not \(5\) parts of \(x\).

B. The length of this segment shows \(2\), \(3\), and \(x\), which represents \(2x + 3x\) correctly because it shows two parts of length \(x\) and three parts of length \(x\), adding up to \(5x\).

C. The area of this figure shows a rectangle with one side labeled \(x\) and the other side divided into \(2\) and \(3\). This would represent an area of \(x \times (2 + 3)\), which is \(5x\), but since the question is about the expression as a length, not an area, this is not the correct representation.

D. The area of this figure shows a rectangle with one side labeled \(5\) and the other side labeled \(x\), which represents an area of \(5x\), but again, since we are looking for a length representation, not an area, this is not the correct representation.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given by the two balance scale images.

From the first image, we can see that one block is heavier than 8 grams because the side with the block is lower than the side with the 8 grams.

From the second image, we can see that three blocks together are lighter than 20 grams because the side with the three blocks is higher than the side with the 20 grams.

Now, let's consider the options given:

[A] If one block weighs 5 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 5 = 15\) grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image. However, 5 grams is less than 8 grams, which contradicts the first image.

[B] If one block weighs 6 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 6 = 18\) grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image. Moreover, 6 grams is less than 8 grams, which contradicts the first image.

[C] If one block weighs 7 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 7 = 21\) grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image.

[D] If one block weighs 8 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 8 = 24\) grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image.

Based on the analysis, none of the options provided are consistent with both images. However, since we must choose one, we should look for the option that is consistent with at least one of the images. Option [B] 6 grams is consistent with the second image, where three blocks weigh less than 20 grams, but it contradicts the first image where one block should weigh more than 8 grams.

There seems to be an error in the problem or the provided options, as none of the weights given in the options satisfy both conditions shown in the images. If we strictly follow the conditions, none of the options [A], [B], [C], or [D] are correct. However, if we are to make an educated guess based on the closest fit, we would choose the option that at least satisfies one of the conditions, which would be:

Answer: [B] $6 \mathrm{~g}$ (with the understanding that this is an educated guess and the actual weight should be slightly more than 8 grams based on the first image).

To solve this problem, we need to consider two parts of the cost: the basic charge and the charge per kilometer.

1. The basic charge is a fixed amount, which is 25 zeds. This is a one-time charge that does not depend on the distance traveled.

2. The charge per kilometer is 0.2 zeds for each kilometer driven. Since we don't know the number of kilometers, we represent it with the variable $n$. The cost for the kilometers driven would be $0.2 \times n$.

3. To find the total cost, we add the basic charge to the charge for the kilometers driven. So, the total cost would be the basic charge (25 zeds) plus the charge per kilometer ($0.2 \times n$).

To complete the table for the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes, we need to find the pattern for the number of black tiles and red tiles in each square shape.

From the given table and the images provided, we can see that the number of black tiles in each square shape is equal to the square of the difference between the side length of the square shape and 2 (since the center of the square is black and the size of the black square increases by one tile on each side for each increase in the overall square size).

So for a $n \times n$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(n - 2)^2$.

For a $6 \times 6$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(6 - 2)^2 = 4^2 = 16$.

For a $7 \times 7$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(7 - 2)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.

Now, the total number of tiles in a square shape is $n^2$ (since it is a square of side length n).

For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the total number of tiles is $6^2 = 36$.

For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the total number of tiles is $7^2 = 49$.

To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles.

For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the number of red tiles is $36 - 16 = 20$.

For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the number of red tiles is $49 - 25 = 24$.

Now we can complete the table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
For the $6 \times 6$ shape: 16 black tiles, 20 red tiles, 36 total tiles.
For the $7 \times 7$ shape: 25 black tiles, 24 red tiles, 49 total tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760A}
To solve this problem, we first need to recognize the pattern in the number of black and red tiles in each of the square shapes that Pat made.

From the information provided:
- A $3 \times 3$ shape has 1 black tile and 8 red tiles.
- A $4 \times 4$ shape has 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles.
- A $5 \times 5$ shape has 9 black tiles and 16 red tiles.

Looking at the pattern, we can see that the number of black tiles in each square is the square of the side length minus 2 (since $3 \times 3 = 9$, $4 \times 4 = 16$, and $5 \times 5 = 25$, then we subtract 2 to get 1, 4, and 9 respectively). 

For a shape with a total of 64 tiles, we can determine that it is an $8 \times 8$ square because $8 \times 8 = 64$. According to the pattern we've observed, the number of black tiles would be the square of the side length minus 2, so for an $8 \times 8$ square, we would have $8^2 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62$ black tiles.

However, this is not consistent with the pattern shown in the table, where the number of black tiles is the square of the side length minus 1 (since $3-1=2$, $4-1=3$, $5-1=4$, and the squares of these are the number of black tiles in each respective square shape). So for an $8 \times 8$ square, we should have $(8-1)^2 = 7^2 = 49$ black tiles.

Then, the number of red tiles would be the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles, which is $64 - 49 = 15$ red tiles.

Therefore, for a shape with a total of 64 tiles, there would be 49 black tiles and 15 red tiles.

Answer:
- Black tiles: 49
- Red tiles: 15

\section{M032760B}

To determine how many red tiles Pat used in the shape with 49 black tiles, we first need to establish the pattern that Pat is following when creating the square shapes with tiles.

From the given information, we can see that:

- In a $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile in the center, and the rest are red tiles.
- In a $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles forming a $2 \times 2$ square in the center, and the rest are red tiles.
- In a $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles forming a $3 \times 3$ square in the center, and the rest are red tiles.

This suggests that the number of black tiles follows the pattern of perfect squares: $1^2$, $2^2$, $3^2$, and so on.

If Pat made a shape with 49 black tiles, we can find the side length of the square of black tiles by taking the square root of 49:

$\sqrt{49} = 7$

This means there is a $7 \times 7$ square of black tiles in the center of the shape.

Now, to find the size of the whole shape, we add 2 to the side length of the black square (since the red tiles form a border that is 1 tile wide around the black square):

$7 + 2 = 9$

So, the whole shape is a $9 \times 9$ square.

The total number of tiles in a $9 \times 9$ square is:

$9 \times 9 = 81$

Since we know there are 49 black tiles, we can calculate the number of red tiles by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

$81 - 49 = 32$

Answer: Pat used 32 red tiles in the shape with 49 black tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
Type of question: Free text response

To determine how many black tiles Pat would need to complete the black part of the shape when using 44 red tiles, we need to identify the pattern in the number of black tiles used in each square shape.

From the provided table and the image, we can see that the black tiles form a smaller square within the larger square made of both red and black tiles. Specifically:

- In the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is $1 \times 1$ black tile.
- In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there is $2 \times 2$ black tiles.
- In the $5 \times 5$ shape, there is $3 \times 3$ black tiles.

We can observe that the number of black tiles is the square of the number of rows less than the total size of the shape (i.e., $3 \times 3$ shape has $3-2 = 1$ row of black tiles, and $1^2 = 1$ black tile; $4 \times 4$ shape has $4-2 = 2$ rows of black tiles, and $2^2 = 4$ black tiles; $5 \times 5$ shape has $5-2 = 3$ rows of black tiles, and $3^2 = 9$ black tiles).

This pattern suggests that for an $n \times n$ square, the number of black tiles needed is $(n-2)^2$. Since we know Pat used 44 red tiles, we need to find the total size of the square shape that would contain 44 red tiles.

The total number of tiles in an $n \times n$ square is $n^2$. Since the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$, the number of red tiles would be the difference between the total number of tiles and the number of black tiles, which is $n^2 - (n-2)^2$.

Given that we have 44 red tiles, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ n^2 - (n-2)^2 = 44 \]

Expanding the equation:
\[ n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = 44 \]
\[ n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4 = 44 \]
\[ 4n = 44 + 4 \]
\[ 4n = 48 \]
\[ n = 12 \]

So the shape is a $12 \times 12$ square. To find the number of black tiles, we calculate:
\[ (12-2)^2 = 10^2 = 100 \]

Answer: Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.

\section{M032761}
Type of question: Free text response.

To complete the line for the shape $n \times n$, we need to determine the expressions for the number of red tiles and the total number of tiles.

1. We are given that the number of black tiles for an $n \times n$ shape is $(n-2)^2$. This makes sense because the black tiles form a smaller square inside the larger square, with each side of the black square being 2 tiles shorter than the larger square.

2. The total number of tiles in an $n \times n$ shape is simply $n^2$, as it is a square with side length $n$.

3. To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles. So, if the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$ and the total number of tiles is $n^2$, then the number of red tiles is:
\[ \text{Number of red tiles} = n^2 - (n-2)^2 \]
\[ \text{Number of red tiles} = n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of red tiles} = 4n - 4 \]

So, the completed line in the table for shape $n \times n$ should be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n - 4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer: Number of Red Tiles: $4n - 4$, Total Number of Tiles: $n^2$.

To determine the next term in the pattern, we need to look at how the sequence is changing from one term to the next. Let's analyze the given terms:

1. The first term is $\frac{1}{2}$.
2. The second term is $\frac{2}{3}$.
3. The third term is $\frac{3}{4}$.
4. The fourth term is $\frac{4}{5}$.
5. The fifth term is $\frac{5}{6}$.

By examining the numerators and denominators separately, we can see that for each term, the numerator is one less than the denominator. Also, as we move from one term to the next, both the numerator and denominator increase by 1.

Given that the last term we have is $\frac{5}{6}$, if we continue the pattern by increasing both the numerator and denominator by 1, the next term would be $\frac{6}{7}$.

Answer: $\frac{6}{7}$.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042198B}
This question is asking for a free text response, as it requires the calculation of the 100th term in a given sequence.

To solve this, let's analyze the pattern in the sequence:
- The first term is $\frac{1}{2}$, which can be written as $\frac{1}{1+1}$.
- The second term is $\frac{2}{3}$, which can be written as $\frac{2}{2+1}$.
- The third term is $\frac{3}{4}$, which can be written as $\frac{3}{3+1}$.
- The fourth term is $\frac{4}{5}$, which can be written as $\frac{4}{4+1}$.
- The fifth term is $\frac{5}{6}$, which can be written as $\frac{5}{5+1}$.

From this pattern, we can deduce that the numerator of each term is the term number and the denominator is one more than the term number. So, the nth term can be written as $\frac{n}{n+1}$.

To find the 100th term, we will substitute $n$ with 100:
- The 100th term would be $\frac{100}{100+1}$, which simplifies to $\frac{100}{101}$.

Answer: [The 100th term is $\frac{100}{101}$].

\section{M042198C}
1. This is a free text response question.

2. To find the pattern, we observe the given sequence of fractions: 
\(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{5}{6}\)

Each fraction has a numerator that is one less than its denominator. The sequence is increasing by one in both the numerator and the denominator for each subsequent term. 

To find the nth term, we can generalize the pattern seen in the sequence. The numerator is always one less than the denominator, and the denominator seems to be one more than the position of the term in the sequence (the first term has a denominator of 2, the second term has a denominator of 3, and so on). 

Therefore, for term number \(n\), the numerator would be \(n-1\) and the denominator would be \(n\).

\[ \frac{n-1}{n} \]

\section{M042228}
The image shows a cross-shaped pattern of numbers with a variable $x$ in the center position. To determine the value of $x$, we need to identify a pattern or rule that relates the numbers.

Observing the pattern, it seems that each number in the middle column is the sum of the numbers directly above and below it. Let's verify this with the numbers given:

- The number 10 is between 4 and 6, and 4 + 6 = 10.
- The number 40 is below 16, so if this pattern holds, the number represented by $x$ should be such that 16 + $x$ = 40.

Now, we can solve for $x$:

16 + $x$ = 40
$x$ = 40 - 16
$x$ = 24

Thus, the value of $x$ that satisfies the pattern is 24.

\section{M042235}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve for the values of \(x\) and \(y\), we need to use a method to solve the system of linear equations. We can use either substitution or elimination. Here, I will use the elimination method.

Step 1: Align the equations and multiply the first equation by 2 to match the coefficient of \(x\) in the second equation.

\(2(x + y) = 2(12)\) which simplifies to \(2x + 2y = 24\)

Now we have:
\(2x + 2y = 24\)
\(2x + 5y = 36\)

Step 2: Subtract the first new equation from the second equation to eliminate \(x\).

\(2x + 5y - (2x + 2y) = 36 - 24\)

This simplifies to:
\(3y = 12\)

Step 3: Solve for \(y\).

\(y = \frac{12}{3} = 4\)

Step 4: Substitute the value of \(y\) back into the first original equation to solve for \(x\).

\(x + 4 = 12\)

\(x = 12 - 4\)

\(x = 8\)

Step 5: Check the solution with the second original equation.

\(2x + 5y = 36\)

\(2(8) + 5(4) = 36\)

\(16 + 20 = 36\)

\(36 = 36\) (This confirms our solution is correct)

Answer: [D] \(x=8, y=4\)

To solve this problem, we need to combine like terms. The like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power. 

Step 1: Identify the like terms in the expression. Here, $3p^2$ and $2p^2$ are like terms because they both have $p$ raised to the power of 2. Similarly, $2p$ and $p$ are like terms because they both have the variable $p$ to the power of 1.

Step 2: Combine the like terms. Add $3p^2$ and $2p^2$ to get $5p^2$. Add $2p$ and $p$ to get $3p$.

Step 3: Write the simplified expression by combining the results from step 2. The simplified expression is $5p^2 + 3p$.

To solve this problem, first, we need to find the value of x. We know that the sum of the lengths of the three pieces must equal the original length of the wood, which is 40 cm.

Let's set up the equation:

\[ 2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the length of each piece:

\[ 2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \ cm \]
\[ x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \ cm \]
\[ x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \ cm \]

The longest piece is the one with the length of \( x + 7 \), which is 15 cm.

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, we need to calculate the area of the entire garden and subtract the area of the path.

The total area of the garden is the product of its length and width. The length is given as \( (x + 4) \) meters, and the width is \( x \) meters. Therefore, the total area of the garden is \( x(x + 4) \) square meters, which simplifies to \( x^2 + 4x \) square meters.

The path divides the garden into two equal shaded portions, and since the path is 1 meter wide, we need to subtract the area of the path from the total area of the garden. The area of the path is the product of its length and width, which is \( x \cdot 1 = x \) square meters.

Since the path runs through the middle of the garden, we subtract its area once from the total area to get the combined area of the two shaded portions. Thus, the area of the shaded portion is \( x^2 + 4x - x \), which simplifies to \( x^2 + 3x \) square meters.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the hole in terms of the number of cubes that would fit into it. By examining the image, we can count the number of cubes along each dimension of the hole.

From the top view, it appears that the hole is 2 cubes wide and 3 cubes long. However, we cannot see the depth of the hole from this angle. To find the depth, we can look at the visible layers of cubes. There is one layer of cubes on the bottom, and two layers on the top, which suggests that the hole is one cube deep.

Now, we can calculate the number of cubes needed to fill the hole by multiplying the dimensions together: 2 (width) x 3 (length) x 1 (depth) = 6 cubes.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the perimeter of the square, we first need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of the side by taking the square root of the area.

The area of the square is given as \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \). Taking the square root of \( 144 \) gives us \( 12 \) because \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \).

Now that we know the length of one side of the square is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \), we can find the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by \( 4 \) (since a square has four equal sides).

So, the perimeter \( P \) is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \times 4 = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total degrees the minute hand turns from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

1. First, we need to understand that a minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$, in 60 minutes.
2. From 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., the minute hand completes 40 minutes of rotation. This is $\frac{40}{60}$ of a full circle. So, the minute hand turns through $360^{\circ} \times \frac{40}{60} = 240^{\circ}$.
3. From 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., the minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$.
4. Now, we add the degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. to the degrees turned from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. to get the total degrees turned by the minute hand.

So, the total degrees turned by the minute hand is $240^{\circ} + 360^{\circ} = 600^{\circ}$.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of angles in triangles. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^{\circ} \).

First, let's find the angle at the top of the larger triangle. We can see that it is part of a smaller triangle with angles of \( 65^{\circ} \) and \( x \). The sum of angles in this smaller triangle must also be \( 180^{\circ} \), so the third angle is \( 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x \).

Now, looking at the larger triangle, we have a \( 45^{\circ} \) angle, a \( 30^{\circ} \) angle, and the angle we just found, which is \( 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x \). The sum of these three angles must equal \( 180^{\circ} \) because they are the angles of the larger triangle.

So, we have:

\[ 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + (180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x) = 180^{\circ} \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 75^{\circ} + 115^{\circ} - x = 180^{\circ} \]

\[ 190^{\circ} - x = 180^{\circ} \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 190^{\circ} - 180^{\circ} \]

\[ x = 10^{\circ} \]

However, none of the options given match \( 10^{\circ} \). It seems there might be a mistake in my calculations or in the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

The sum of the angles in the smaller triangle is:

\[ 65^{\circ} + x + (180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x) = 180^{\circ} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 180^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]

Which is a tautology and does not help us find \( x \). Let's instead find the angle at the top of the larger triangle directly:

\[ 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 115^{\circ} \]

Now, sum up the angles in the larger triangle:

\[ 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + 115^{\circ} = 190^{\circ} \]

This is incorrect because the sum of angles in a triangle must be \( 180^{\circ} \). The correct calculation should be:

\[ 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + x = 180^{\circ} \]

\[ 75^{\circ} + x = 180^{\circ} \]

\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 75^{\circ} \]

\[ x = 105^{\circ} \]

But this answer is also not among the options, and it's larger than the largest option. Let's try again, this time more carefully:

The angle at the top of the larger triangle is \( 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 115^{\circ} \).

Now, we can calculate \( x \) by subtracting the known angles of the larger triangle from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 45^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 75^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 105^{\circ} \]

This is the same result as before, which indicates a mistake in the options provided or in the interpretation of the figure. Since none of the options match, I would have to question the validity of the options or the figure itself. However, based on the calculations, \( x \) should be \( 105^{\circ} \), which is not listed as an option.

Answer: There seems to be an error as none of the provided options match the calculated value of \( x \). Based on the calculations, \( x \) should be \( 105^{\circ} \), but this is not an available choice.

\section{M032402}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine which of the given reasons explains why triangle $PQR$ is a right-angled triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's evaluate each option:

[A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

This option is applying the Pythagorean theorem. We can calculate each side of the equation to verify if it's true:

Left side: $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$
Right side: $5^2 = 25$

Since both sides are equal, this option correctly applies the Pythagorean theorem, suggesting that triangle $PQR$ could indeed be a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm.

[B] $5 < 3 + 4$

This option states that the length of the hypotenuse (5 cm) is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides (3 cm and 4 cm). While this is a necessary condition for any triangle (the Triangle Inequality Theorem), it does not specifically confirm that the triangle is right-angled.

[C] $3 + 4 = 12 - 5$

This option is simply an arithmetic statement that is true (7 = 7), but it does not provide any geometric information about the triangle being right-angled.

[D] $3 > 5 - 4$

This option states that one leg of the triangle (3 cm) is greater than the difference between the hypotenuse (5 cm) and the other leg (4 cm). This is also true but does not confirm that the triangle is right-angled.

Answer: [A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the shaded region, we first need to calculate the area of the entire rectangle and then subtract the area of the white triangular region.

The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 16 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

The area of the white triangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Now, subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region:
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of rectangle} - \text{Area of triangle} \]
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 - 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 72 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the shape of the cutout figure, we need to visualize the folding and cutting process described.

1. The paper is folded in half, which means the cut will be symmetrical along the fold line.
2. The dotted line indicates where the paper will be cut. Since the paper is folded, cutting along this line will produce two identical shapes.
3. The dotted line starts from one corner of the folded paper and ends 1 cm away from the adjacent side, creating a triangle shape.
4. The triangle will have two equal sides (the 4 cm sides) because the cut starts from the corner and the paper is folded in half, making the two halves mirror images of each other.
5. The base of the triangle (the side that is 1 cm away from the edge of the paper) will be the same length on both sides of the folded paper, making it an isosceles triangle.

Since the cut is made while the paper is folded, two identical triangles will be created when the paper is unfolded.

Answer: [B] two isosceles triangles

Think step by step, and describe your thought process and reasoning:
1. The initial shape is a square with triangles attached to each side along the midpoints of the square's edges.
2. When the triangle flaps are folded up, they will form a three-dimensional shape with the square as the base.
3. From a top-down view, the square base will still be visible.
4. The triangle flaps will not be visible from directly above as they would be perpendicular to the viewpoint, folding upwards and touching the adjacent flaps.

Answer:
To complete the diagram to show what the shape would look like when viewed from directly above, you would simply draw the square, as the triangles would be perpendicular to the top view and thus not visible. The second image provided is already correct as it shows a square which would represent the top view of the base of the shape. No additional drawing is required.

A. The shape is a trapezoid and does not appear to have a line of symmetry.
B. The shape is a triangle with one line of symmetry down the middle, indicated by the line with arrows.
C. The shape is a parallelogram and does not have a line of symmetry because the opposite sides are parallel but not of equal length.

\section{M042152}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, imagine the triangle in the first image being rotated 180 degrees (a half-turn) around point O. This means that the triangle will end up on the opposite side of point O, and it will be flipped over.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The triangle is currently pointing upwards and to the right.
2. After a half-turn clockwise rotation, the triangle should point downwards and to the left.
3. The position of the triangle will be diagonally opposite from its current position with respect to point O.
4. The triangle should also be a mirror image of its current state because a half-turn rotation includes flipping it over.

Looking at the options in the second image:
- Option A shows the triangle pointing upwards, which is not correct.
- Option B shows the triangle pointing downwards and to the right, which is not correct because it should be flipped.
- Option C shows the triangle pointing upwards and to the left, which is not correct.
- Option D shows the triangle pointing downwards and to the left, which is the correct orientation after a half-turn clockwise rotation.

\section{M042201}
This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( x \), we need to use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

From the image, we are given that the height is 4 cm and the width is 5 cm. The volume of the box is given as 200 cm³. We can set up the equation:

\[ 200 \text{ cm}^3 = x \text{ cm} \times 5 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm} \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by the product of the width and the height (5 cm * 4 cm):

\[ x = \frac{200 \text{ cm}^3}{5 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm}} \]

\[ x = \frac{200 \text{ cm}^3}{20 \text{ cm}^2} \]

\[ x = 10 \text{ cm} \]

Type of question: Drawing

To draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm on the given grid where each small square represents 1 cm, follow these steps:

1. Select a point on the grid to start the base of the triangle. Make sure there is enough space above this point to draw the height of the triangle.

2. Count 4 squares horizontally from the starting point to mark the end of the base, since the length of the base is 4 cm. Draw a horizontal line to represent the base of the triangle.

3. Find the midpoint of the base by counting 2 squares from either end of the base line. This midpoint will be directly below the apex of the isosceles triangle.

4. From the midpoint of the base, draw a vertical line upwards that spans 5 squares, since the height of the triangle is 5 cm. This line represents the height of the triangle and ends at the apex.

5. Connect the apex to each end of the base with straight lines. These lines will be the equal sides of the isosceles triangle.

6. Erase any unnecessary lines if needed.

The resulting figure should be an isosceles triangle with a 4 cm base and a 5 cm height, with the two equal sides sloping down from the apex to the base's endpoints.

Since I'm unable to physically mark or draw on images, I'll guide you through the steps to complete the task.

1. To mark point B with coordinates (3, 30°):
   - Find the 30° line starting at the origin O.
   - Move along this line to the circle that represents a distance of 3 from the origin.

   To mark point C with coordinates (4, 120°):
   - Find the 120° line starting at the origin O.
   - Move along this line to the circle that represents a distance of 4 from the origin.

2. To draw the angle BOC:
   - Draw a line from point B to the origin O.
   - Draw another line from point C to the origin O.
   - The angle BOC is the angle between these two lines.

To calculate the measure of angle BOC:
   - The angle at point B is 30° from the baseline OA.
   - The angle at point C is 120° from the baseline OA.
   - The angle BOC is the difference between the angle at C and the angle at B.
   - Therefore, angle BOC = 120° - 30° = 90°.

Angle BOC = 90°.

\section{M052084}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of a square, we need to know the length of one of its sides. Since the perimeter of a square is the sum of all four of its sides, we can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by 4.

Given the perimeter is $36 \mathrm{~cm}$, we divide this by 4 to find the length of one side:

$36 \mathrm{~cm} \div 4 = 9 \mathrm{~cm}$

Now that we know each side of the square is 9 cm, we can find the area by squaring this length (since the area of a square is side length squared):

Area = side length × side length = $9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

This problem involves calculating the volume of the box and the volume of a single book to determine how many books can fit into the box. To find the largest number of books that can fit, we need to divide the volume of the box by the volume of one book.

1. Calculate the volume of the box:
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = 36 \, \text{cm} \times 30 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = 21600 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

2. Calculate the volume of one book:
\[ \text{Volume of one book} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one book} = 20 \, \text{cm} \times 15 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one book} = 1800 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

3. Divide the volume of the box by the volume of one book to find out how many books can fit:
\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Volume of the box}}{\text{Volume of one book}} \]
\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{21600 \, \text{cm}^3}{1800 \, \text{cm}^3} \]
\[ \text{Number of books} = 12 \]

\section{M052362}
This question is a free-text response type.

Step by step reasoning:

1. Given that AC = BC, we know that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with the two equal sides being AC and BC.

2. The line CX appears to be perpendicular to AB, suggesting that triangle ACX is a right triangle. Since AB is twice as long as CX, and we know that in a right triangle the hypotenuse is the longest side, the side AC (which is equal to BC) must be longer than CX but shorter than AB.

3. Since AC = BC and CX is perpendicular to AB, triangles ACX and BCX are congruent right triangles (by the Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence Theorem). This means all corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, the angles ACX and BCX are equal.

4. In a triangle, the sum of the angles equals 180 degrees. Since triangle ACX is a right triangle, angle ACX is 90 degrees. Now, since ACX and BCX are congruent, angle BCX must also be 90 degrees.

5. This leaves angle B to be the remaining angle in triangle ABC. Since triangles ACX and BCX are congruent and right-angled, the two angles at C (ACX and BCX) sum up to 180 degrees. This means there are no degrees left for angle B within triangle ABC, which means it must be a straight line.

6. Therefore, the size of angle B in this triangle is 180 degrees (a straight line).

Answer: 180 degrees

This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( b \), we need to use the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal. The lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel, and there is a transversal line that intersects them, creating several angles.

The \( 70^\circ \) angle and the angle marked \( b \) are corresponding angles because they are in the same relative position at the intersection with the transversal line. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are congruent.

Therefore, the measure of angle \( b \) is equal to the measure of the corresponding angle, which is \( 70^\circ \).

Answer: \( b = 70^\circ \).

To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of Peter getting a pink candy after Megan has already gotten one. Initially, since there are an equal number of each color of candy, the probability of getting a pink candy would be the same for any color. However, after Megan takes a pink candy, there are fewer pink candies left compared to the other colors.

Step by step:
1. Initially, there were 100 candies with an equal number of each color, so 25 of each color.
2. Megan took a pink candy, leaving 24 pink candies and still 25 of each of the other colors.
3. Now, there are 99 candies in total.
4. The probability of Peter getting a pink candy is now 24 out of 99, which is slightly less than the initial probability of 25 out of 100.

Answer: [D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

To solve this, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector and then apply that probability to the total number of spins.

First, we count the number of sectors. There are 5 sectors in total: Orange, Green, Blue, Red, and Purple.

Since the spinner is divided equally into these sectors, the probability of landing on any one sector, including the red sector, is 1/5.

Now, we apply this probability to the total number of spins:

(1/5) * 600 = 120

However, this result is not one of the options provided, which suggests there might be an error in the interpretation of the image or the question. Since I cannot make assumptions beyond the information given, I will choose the closest answer to my calculation.

\section{M032681A}
To determine by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, as it represents the actual car production by the NU Car Motor Company during the day in question.

To find the time when the production reached 150 cars, follow these steps:

1. Locate the point on the vertical axis that is level with the number 150 for the total number of cars produced.
2. Move horizontally from the 150 mark until you reach the solid line that represents the actual car production.
3. From the point where you meet the solid line, move vertically downwards to intersect the horizontal time axis.

Looking at the graph, the solid line crosses the 150 cars produced level at a point that is just before 12 noon. To be more precise, it appears to be slightly before half past 11 am. However, without an exact scale between the hour marks, it's not possible to determine the exact minute. Therefore, it's safe to say that by approximately 11:30 am, a total of 150 cars had been produced.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
To calculate the average number of cars produced per hour on this day by the NU Car Motor Company, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, which represents the actual car production.

First, we need to determine the total number of cars produced by the end of the day. At 4 pm, the graph shows that the total number of cars produced is just under 400. For the purposes of this calculation, I will assume the total number of cars produced is exactly 400, as it's very close to that number and it's difficult to determine the exact figure from the graph.

Next, we need to calculate the total time period for car production. The graph starts at 8 am and ends at 4 pm, which is a span of 8 hours.

Now we can calculate the average number of cars produced per hour by dividing the total number of cars produced by the total number of hours.

Average number of cars produced per hour = Total number of cars produced / Total number of hours
Average number of cars produced per hour = 400 cars / 8 hours
Average number of cars produced per hour = 50 cars per hour

Answer: [50 cars per hour]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681C}
The graph shows the total number of cars produced over time, with the solid line representing the actual car production and the dotted line representing what the production would be if it were constant throughout the day.

To determine during which hour the most cars were produced, we need to look for the hour where the solid line has the steepest slope, because the steepest slope indicates the fastest rate of production.

By examining the graph, we can see that the slope of the solid line is steepest between 1 pm and 2 pm. This means that the rate of production was highest during this hour, and therefore, the most cars were produced in this time frame.

Answer: Between 1 pm and 2 pm.

\section{M032695}
To create a pie chart, we need to calculate the angle for each sector that represents the different categories of students' plans after leaving school. The total number of students is 400. The sum of the angles in a circle is 360 degrees, so each student represents 360/400 degrees.

Here's the breakdown:
- University: 50 students
- Polytechnic: 100 students
- Business college: 150 students
- Workforce: 400 - (50 + 100 + 150) = 100 students

Now let's calculate the angle for each sector:
- University: (50/400) * 360 = 45 degrees
- Polytechnic: (100/400) * 360 = 90 degrees
- Business college: (150/400) * 360 = 135 degrees
- Workforce: (100/400) * 360 = 90 degrees

Since I can't draw on the image, I'll describe the steps:

1. Start from the top of the circle (12 o'clock position) and measure the angle clockwise for each category using a protractor.
2. For the university, measure 45 degrees clockwise from the top.
3. Label this sector "University."
4. From the end of that sector, measure 90 degrees for the polytechnic.
5. Label this sector "Polytechnic."
6. From the end of the polytechnic sector, measure 135 degrees for the business college.
7. Label this sector "Business College."
8. The remaining sector, which will also measure 90 degrees, is for those entering the workforce.
9. Label this last sector "Workforce."

Each sector should be proportional to the number of students planning to go to each post-school destination. Remember to use a protractor for precise measurements and label each sector accordingly.

\section{M032721}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to estimate the rate of change in sales for each type of soft drink and then project when the sales of Cherry Cola will equal the sales of Lemon Cola.

From the graph, we can see that the sales of Lemon Cola are decreasing each year, while the sales of Cherry Cola are increasing. We need to estimate the average yearly change in sales for each type of soft drink.

For Lemon Cola:
- From 1998 to 1999, the sales decrease from about 55 million to about 52 million cans, which is a decrease of 3 million cans.
- From 1999 to 2000, the sales decrease from about 52 million to about 49 million cans, which is a decrease of 3 million cans.
- From 2000 to 2001, the sales decrease from about 49 million to about 46 million cans, which is a decrease of 3 million cans.

It appears that Lemon Cola's sales are decreasing by about 3 million cans per year.

For Cherry Cola:
- From 1998 to 1999, the sales increase from about 10 million to about 20 million cans, which is an increase of 10 million cans.
- From 1999 to 2000, the sales increase from about 20 million to about 30 million cans, which is an increase of 10 million cans.
- From 2000 to 2001, the sales increase from about 30 million to about 40 million cans, which is an increase of 10 million cans.

It appears that Cherry Cola's sales are increasing by about 10 million cans per year.

Now, we need to determine when the sales of Cherry Cola will equal the sales of Lemon Cola. In 2001, the difference in sales is about 6 million cans (46 million for Lemon Cola and 40 million for Cherry Cola). Since Cherry Cola is increasing by 10 million cans per year and Lemon Cola is decreasing by 3 million cans per year, the difference in sales is closing by 13 million cans per year (10 million + 3 million).

To find out how many years it will take for Cherry Cola to catch up, we divide the difference in sales by the rate at which the gap is closing:

6 million cans / 13 million cans per year = 0.46 years

Since we are looking for the nearest whole year and we start counting from the year 2001, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take approximately 1 year for Cherry Cola to catch up to Lemon Cola.

Adding 1 year to 2001 gives us 2002. However, this option is not listed in the multiple-choice answers. Given the options available, it seems there may be an error in the question or the options provided. Based on the information from the graph and the calculations, none of the provided options [A] 2003, [B] 2004, [C] 2005, or [D] 2006 are correct.

Answer: None of the provided options are correct based on the graph and the calculations. The correct year should be 2002.

To find the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants, we need to add up the total number of staff members and then divide that sum by the number of restaurants. 

So, we add the number of staff members from each restaurant: \(12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30\).

Now, we calculate the sum: \(12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30 = 100\).

Finally, we divide this sum by the number of restaurants, which is 5: \(100 \div 5 = 20\).

To find the median of a set of numbers, you need to order the numbers from smallest to largest and then find the middle value. With an odd number of values, the median will be the number that is exactly in the middle of the list. Since there are 5 restaurants, the median will be the third value when the numbers are ordered.

The numbers of staff members are: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30.

First, we order them: 12, 18, 19, 21, 30.

Since there are 5 numbers, the median will be the third number in this ordered list.

3. Answer: [19]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042169C}
Type of question: Free text response

First, let's analyze the current situation before the increase in staff members at the restaurant with 30 employees.

The numbers of staff members are: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30. 

To find the median, we arrange the numbers in ascending order (which they already are), and since there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle number. In this case, the median is 19.

To find the mean, we add all the numbers together and divide by the total number of values. That is: (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20.

Now, let's consider the changes after the restaurant with 30 staff members increases its number to 50.

The new set of numbers will be: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 50. 

To find the new median, we again arrange the numbers in ascending order (which they already are), and since there is still an odd number of values, the median remains the middle number. In this case, the median is still 19 (unchanged).

To find the new mean, we add all the new numbers together and divide by the total number of values. That is: (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

So, the median remains unchanged at 19, but the mean increases from 20 to 24.

Answer:
- The median remains unchanged.
- The mean increases from 20 to 24.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate $50\%$ of 1,200 bottles because the shopkeeper's average sales of regular-sized bottles of soda are $50\%$.

Step by step, we can calculate this as follows:

1. Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: $50\% = 50/100 = 0.5$.
2. Multiply the total number of bottles by this decimal: $0.5 \times 1,200 = 600$.

Answer:
[C] 600

\section{M042179}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing either a blue button or a white button from the bag. The total number of buttons in the bag is the sum of red, blue, and white buttons, which is 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 buttons.

The number of favorable outcomes for drawing a blue button is 8, and for drawing a white button is 4. Since these are mutually exclusive events (a button cannot be both blue and white), we can add the number of blue buttons to the number of white buttons to get the total number of favorable outcomes for either event. This gives us 8 + 4 = 12 favorable outcomes.

The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of drawing either a blue or a white button is 12 (favorable outcomes) divided by 22 (total outcomes).

Therefore, the probability is $\frac{12}{22}$.

Answer: [D] $\frac{12}{22}$

\section{M042207}
This is a drawing type of question.

To complete and label the given pie chart with the data provided, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students: 60 (Hockey) + 180 (Football) + 120 (Tennis) + 120 (Basketball) = 480 students.

2. Determine the percentage of the pie chart each sport will occupy:
   - Hockey: \( \frac{60}{480} \times 100 = 12.5\% \)
   - Football: \( \frac{180}{480} \times 100 = 37.5\% \)
   - Tennis: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100 = 25\% \)
   - Basketball: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100 = 25\% \)

3. Convert these percentages to angles for the pie chart since the total angle in a circle is 360 degrees:
   - Hockey: \( 12.5\% \times 360 = 45^\circ \)
   - Football: \( 37.5\% \times 360 = 135^\circ \)
   - Tennis: \( 25\% \times 360 = 90^\circ \)
   - Basketball: \( 25\% \times 360 = 90^\circ \)

4. Draw the segments on the pie chart using the calculated angles:
   - Start from a fixed point (usually the top or the right side of the circle) and measure out the angle for each sport using a protractor.
   - For Hockey, measure a 45-degree angle, for Football a 135-degree angle, for Tennis and Basketball, measure a 90-degree angle each.

5. Label each segment with the sport's name and the corresponding percentage or number of students:
   - Place the label "Hockey" next to the 45-degree segment with either "12.5%" or "60 students."
   - Label the 135-degree segment with "Football" and either "37.5%" or "180 students."
   - Label one of the 90-degree segments with "Tennis" and either "25%" or "120 students."
   - Label the remaining 90-degree segment with "Basketball" and either "25%" or "120 students."

6. Make sure the segments are proportional to the data given, and the labels are clear and readable.

Please note that I cannot physically draw the pie chart for you, but these instructions should guide you on how to complete and label the pie chart accurately.

\section{M042260}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To answer this question, we need to understand the percentage of votes that each candidate received. Pat received 80% of the votes, and Chris received 20% of the votes. 

If a student is picked at random, the likelihood of them having voted for a particular candidate would be proportional to the percentage of votes that candidate received. Since Pat received 80% of the votes, it means that out of every 100 students, 80 are likely to have voted for Pat. This is a high probability.

Therefore, it is likely that a student picked at random would have voted for Pat.

Answer: [B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.

\section{M042269}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine which statement must be true based on the given information, let's analyze each option:

[A] This statement cannot be confirmed as true just based on the average lengths. Even if Team B's average is higher, it doesn't necessarily mean that each individual student on Team B jumped farther than every student on Team A.

[B] This statement is similar to [A] and also cannot be confirmed as true based on averages alone. It's possible that some students in team A jumped farther than some students in team B, but the overall average for Team B was higher due to other factors.

[C] This statement is true because the average jump length for Team B is higher than that of Team A. Since there were the same number of students in each team, the total distance jumped by Team B as a group would be greater than that of Team A.

[D] This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given averages. It is possible, but not certain, that some students in Team A jumped farther than some in Team B.

Answer: [C] As a group, team B jumped farther than team A.

\section{M052429}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand that since Sue puts the marble back into the bag, the second draw is independent of the first draw. This means that the outcome of the first draw does not affect the second draw. 

Since the marble is put back, the composition of the bag remains the same for the second draw as it was for the first draw. There are still 5 red marbles and 5 blue marbles in the bag, making a total of 10 marbles.

The probability of drawing a red marble is therefore the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is:

Probability of drawing a red marble = Number of red marbles / Total number of marbles
Probability of drawing a red marble = 5/10
Probability of drawing a red marble = 1/2

Answer: [A] $\frac{1}{2}$

\section{M052503A}
The age structure of a country can have a significant impact on its population growth. In the graphs provided, Country X has a broad base, which means a large proportion of the population is in the youngest age group (ages 0-19). This suggests that there are many young people who will soon be entering their childbearing years. As these individuals grow older and start families, they will contribute to a higher birth rate, which can lead to rapid population growth.

On the other hand, Country Y has a narrower base and a more uniform distribution across age groups. This indicates a smaller proportion of the population is in the youngest age group. With fewer individuals entering their childbearing years, the birth rate is likely to be lower, resulting in slower population growth.

In summary, the age structure of Country X, with its larger youth population, suggests a potential for higher birth rates and more rapid population growth compared to Country Y, which has a smaller youth population relative to the other age groups.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503B}
The image shows two population pyramids comparing the age structure of Country X and Country Y. Population pyramids are graphical illustrations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population, which typically forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for the following reasons:

1. The shape of Country Y's pyramid indicates slow growth, with a larger proportion of the population in the older age groups (45-89 years), as shown by the broad top of the pyramid. This suggests that there is a relatively high number of elderly people compared to younger people.

2. In contrast, Country X's pyramid shows rapid growth, with a much larger base representing the younger population (ages 0-19) and a narrower top representing the elderly population. This implies that there is a relatively large number of young people who can potentially support the elderly.

3. The demographic structure of Country Y suggests an aging population with a smaller percentage of the population in the younger age groups who will enter the workforce. This means there will be fewer working-age individuals to support the elderly both economically (through taxes and social security systems) and through caregiving roles.

4. The burden of care on the smaller working-age population in Country Y could be greater since there are more elderly individuals who may require support, healthcare, and pensions, with fewer younger individuals to provide the necessary resources.

Overall, the population structure of Country Y indicates a demographic trend towards an older population, which can lead to challenges in providing adequate care and support for the elderly, potentially leading to a larger problem in managing the needs of this age group.
