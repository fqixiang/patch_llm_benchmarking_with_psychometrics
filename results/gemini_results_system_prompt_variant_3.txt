\section{M032757}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.
2. The table shows the number of tiles for the first three shapes Pat made. We can see that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape, and the number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape. So, for the $6 \times 6$ shape, the number of black tiles will be 16 + 3 = 19, and the number of red tiles will be 16 + 4 = 20. So, the total number of tiles will be 19 + 20 = 39. For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the number of black tiles will be 19 + 3 = 22, and the number of red tiles will be 20 + 4 = 24. So, the total number of tiles will be 22 + 24 = 46.
3. The answer is:
$6 \times 6$: 19 black tiles, 20 red tiles, 39 total tiles
$7 \times 7$: 22 black tiles, 24 red tiles, 46 total tiles
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760A}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.

2. We can see that the number of black tiles is increasing by 2 for each shape, and the number of red tiles is increasing by 4 for each shape. So, for the shape with a total of 64 tiles, the number of black tiles will be 9 and the number of red tiles will be 55.

3. Answer: 9 black tiles and 55 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.
2. We can see that the number of black tiles is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. The number of black tiles is the square of the side length.

The number of red tiles is 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32. The number of red tiles is 4 times the side length.

For a shape that used 49 black tiles, the side length is 7. The number of red tiles is 4 times the side length, so the number of red tiles is 4 * 7 = 28.

3. The answer is 28.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. First, let's find out the pattern of the number of black tiles. 
The number of black tiles in the $3 \times 3$ shape is 1. 
The number of black tiles in the $4 \times 4$ shape is 4, which is 1 more than the number of black tiles in the $3 \times 3$ shape. 
The number of black tiles in the $5 \times 5$ shape is 9, which is 5 more than the number of black tiles in the $4 \times 4$ shape. 
So the number of black tiles in the $n \times n$ shape is $n^2 - (n - 1)^2 = n^2 - (n^2 - 2n + 1) = 2n - 1$.
Next, let's find out the pattern of the number of red tiles. 
The number of red tiles in the $3 \times 3$ shape is 8. 
The number of red tiles in the $4 \times 4$ shape is 12, which is 4 more than the number of red tiles in the $3 \times 3$ shape. 
The number of red tiles in the $5 \times 5$ shape is 16, which is 8 more than the number of red tiles in the $4 \times 4$ shape. 
So the number of red tiles in the $n \times n$ shape is $n^2$.
Now let's find out the number of black tiles Pat needs to complete the black part of the shape. 
Since there are 44 red tiles, the shape is a $7 \times 7$ shape. 
The number of black tiles in the $7 \times 7$ shape is $2 \times 7 - 1 = 13$.
3. The answer is [D].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. The question type is free text response.

2. Let's think step by step. For the $n \times n$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$. This is because there are $(n-2)$ black tiles on each side of the square, and there are four sides. The number of red tiles is $n^2 - (n-2)^2 = 4n - 4$. This is because there are $n^2$ tiles in total, and $(n-2)^2$ of them are black tiles. The total number of tiles is $n^2$.

3. The answer is $4n-4$.

\section{M032398}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. We can see that the angle on the left is 45 degrees, and the angle on the right is 30 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we know that the angle at the top must be 180 - 45 - 30 = 105 degrees. The angle bisectors of a triangle divide the angles in half, so we know that the angle bisector of the top angle must be 105 / 2 = 52.5 degrees. Therefore, the value of x is 52.5 degrees.
3. The answer is [C] 45^{\circ}.

-------------------------------------------
\section{M042270}
 1. The question is asking you to draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm. An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal sides, so you will need to draw a triangle with a base of 4 cm and two equal sides of 5 cm.


2. To draw the triangle, you will first need to draw the base. The base is 4 cm long, so you will need to draw a line 4 cm long.


3. Next, you will need to draw the two equal sides of the triangle. The sides are 5 cm long, so you will need to draw two lines 5 cm long from the endpoints of the base.


4. Finally, you will need to connect the endpoints of the two equal sides to form the triangle.


5. The final step is to check that the triangle is an isosceles triangle. To do this, you will need to measure the two equal sides and make sure that they are the same length. You will also need to measure the base and make sure that it is shorter than the two equal sides.


6. If the triangle is not an isosceles triangle, you will need to adjust the lengths of the sides until it is.


7. Once you are satisfied that the triangle is an isosceles triangle, you can finish the drawing.

\section{M052503A}
 1. The question is asking about the age structure of two countries and its impact on population growth. It is a multiple-choice question.


2. The graphs show the age structure of the population in Country X and Country Y. The age structure of Country X is younger than the age structure of Country Y. This means that there are more people in Country X who are in the 0-19 age group and fewer people in Country X who are in the 20-44 age group.


3. The age structure of Country X could lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y because there are more people in Country X who are in the 0-19 age group. This means that there will be more people in Country X who will be entering the 20-44 age group in the future. The 20-44 age group is the age group when most people have children. So, the larger number of people in the 0-19 age group in Country X will lead to a larger number of people in the 20-44 age group in the future. This will lead to more births and more rapid population growth in Country X.


4. Answer: [A]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503A}
