To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jenny gets and then subtract that amount from the total to find out how much Ann gets.

1. Since Jenny gets $\frac{3}{8}$ of the $560$ zeds, we need to calculate $\frac{3}{8}$ of $560$.
2. To do this, we multiply $560$ by $\frac{3}{8}$.
3. This calculation will give us the amount Jenny receives.
4. Once we know how much Jenny receives, we subtract that amount from the total ($560$ zeds) to find out how much Ann receives.

Let's do the calculation:

Jenny's amount = $\frac{3}{8} \times 560$ 
= $3 \times 70$
= $210$ zeds.

Now, we subtract Jenny's amount from the total to find Ann's amount:

Ann's amount = Total - Jenny's amount
= $560 - 210$
= $350$ zeds.

Answer: [Ann will get 350 zeds].

To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions together. Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before we can add them. The easiest common denominator to use here is 1000 since 100 is a factor of 1000. 

First, we convert $\frac{4}{100}$ to a fraction with a denominator of 1000 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 10. This gives us $\frac{40}{1000}$. 

Now we can add $\frac{40}{1000}$ and $\frac{3}{1000}$ together since they have the same denominator. 

Adding the numerators gives us $40 + 3 = 43$. 

So, $\frac{40}{1000} + \frac{3}{1000} = \frac{43}{1000}$.

Converting this fraction to decimal form, we divide 43 by 1000, which gives us 0.043.

Answer: [A] 0.043

To solve this problem, we need to estimate the values in the fraction to make the calculation easier. 

Step 1: Estimate the numerator. The numbers 7.21 and 3.86 can be rounded to 7 and 4, respectively, because they are closer to these whole numbers than to any others.

Step 2: Estimate the denominator. The number 10.09 is very close to 10, so we can round it to 10 for our estimate.

Step 3: Put the estimates together. The estimated fraction is now $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$.

Step 4: Check the options. Option [B] matches our estimated fraction.

Answer: [B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. 

Step 1: Determine if 36 is a prime number or a composite number. Since 36 can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.

Step 2: Find the prime factors of 36. We can start by dividing 36 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 
36 ÷ 2 = 18. Now we have 2 (which is prime) and 18 (which is not prime).

Step 3: We continue to factorize 18, which is also divisible by 2. 
18 ÷ 2 = 9. Now we have another 2 and 9.

Step 4: 9 is not a prime number, but it is a square of a prime number, which is 3. 
9 ÷ 3 = 3. Now we have two 3's.

Step 5: We have now expressed 36 as a product of prime factors: 2 × 2 × 3 × 3.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

1. Type of question: This is a multiple choice question.

2. Thought process and reasoning: To determine the location of \( N \) on the number line, we need to consider the multiplication of two fractions, \( P \) and \( Q \). Since both \( P \) and \( Q \) are located between 0 and 1, they are both less than 1. Multiplying two numbers that are each less than 1 will result in a product that is also less than 1. Therefore, \( N \) must be located somewhere between 0 and 1 on the number line.

Looking at the options:
- Option A places \( N \) between 1 and 2, which is not possible since \( N \) must be less than 1.
- Option B places \( N \) exactly at 1, which is not possible because neither \( P \) nor \( Q \) is equal to 1, and their product must be less than 1.
- Option C places \( N \) between \( P \) and \( Q \), which is not possible because the product of two numbers less than 1 must be less than either of the factors.
- Option D places \( N \) between 0 and \( P \), which is the only plausible location since \( N \) must be less than both \( P \) and \( Q \).

To convert $3 \frac{5}{6}$ to decimal form, we first need to convert the fractional part $\frac{5}{6}$ to a decimal. 

Step 1: Divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator. 
So, we divide 5 by 6 which gives us 0.8333...

Step 2: Since we need to round to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal place. If it is 5 or more, we round the second decimal place up. In this case, the third decimal place is 3, which is less than 5, so we do not round up.

Step 3: Combine the whole number part with the decimal part. 
The whole number part is 3, and the decimal part is 0.83 (after rounding to two decimal places).

\section{M042002}
This is a free-text response question where we need to place the digits 3, 5, 7, and 9 in the boxes to create two two-digit numbers that, when multiplied, give the greatest product.

To maximize the product of two numbers with these digits, we want the larger digits to be in the tens place because the tens place contributes more to the overall value of the number than the ones place. Therefore, we should place the larger of the four digits, 9 and 7, in the tens places of the two numbers.

Between 3 and 5, 5 is larger, so we should place it in the ones place of the number that already has 9 in the tens place to maximize the value of that number. The remaining digit, 3, would go in the ones place of the number with 7 in the tens place.

So the greatest product is achieved by forming the two-digit numbers 95 and 73, and then multiplying them.

Answer: The digits should be placed as 9 and 5 in the first number and 7 and 3 in the second number to maximize the product, forming the numbers 95 and 73.

First, I observe the number line and note that it is marked at whole numbers 26 and 28, with 27 in between. There are ten small marks between each whole number, which indicates that each small mark represents a tenth (0.1).

The letter $K$ is placed two marks to the right of 27. Since each mark represents 0.1, two marks to the right of 27 would represent an increase of 0.2.

Therefore, the value of $K$ on the number line is 27 plus 0.2, which equals 27.2.

To find the value of the square that makes the fractions equivalent, we need to find a number that, when divided by 21, gives the same value as 4 divided by 14. 

Step by step:
1. Simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ to its lowest terms. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 14, which is 2. 
2. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD: $\frac{4 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{2}{7}$.
3. Now we need to find a number that, when placed in the numerator over 21, gives us the simplified fraction $\frac{2}{7}$.
4. To keep the fractions equivalent, we multiply the numerator of the simplified fraction by the same factor that we would multiply the denominator by to get from 7 to 21. Since $7 \times 3 = 21$, we do the same for the numerator: $2 \times 3 = 6$.
5. Therefore, the value of the square must be 6 to make the fractions equivalent.

To find the fraction equivalent to 0.125, we need to express 0.125 as a fraction in its simplest form.

Step 1: Recognize that 0.125 is the same as 125 thousandths, which can be written as $\frac{125}{1000}$.

Step 2: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 125 and 1000. The GCD of 125 and 1000 is 125.

Step 3: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction. $\frac{125 \div 125}{1000 \div 125} = \frac{1}{8}$.

Step 4: Now, we need to find which of the given options matches the simplified fraction $\frac{1}{8}$.

Option [A] $\frac{125}{100}$ simplifies to $\frac{5}{4}$, which is not equivalent to $\frac{1}{8}$.

Option [B] $\frac{125}{1,000}$ is already in the form we found in Step 1, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{8}$.

Option [C] $\frac{125}{10,000}$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{80}$, which is not equivalent to $\frac{1}{8}$.

Option [D] $\frac{125}{100,000}$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{800}$, which is not equivalent to $\frac{1}{8}$.

2. To find the percentage of successful shots for James, we need to divide the number of successful shots by the total number of tries and multiply by 100. James has 15 successful shots out of 20, so the calculation would be (15/20) * 100.

For Andrew, we are given the percentage of successful shots (80%) and need to find the number of successful shots out of 20. To find this, we take the percentage and apply it to the total number of tries. So we calculate 80% of 20, which is (80/100) * 20.

3. For James: 
\[ \frac{15}{20} \times 100 = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75\% \]

For Andrew:
\[ \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = \frac{4}{5} \times 20 = 16 \]

The given pattern shows a sequence of subtraction operations starting with the number 3. In each subsequent step, the subtracted number decreases by 1 and the result increases by 1. The pattern is as follows:
- In the first line, $3-3=0$, the number subtracted from 3 is 3 itself, resulting in 0.
- In the second line, $3-2=1$, the number subtracted is reduced by 1 (from 3 to 2), resulting in 1.
- In the third line, $3-1=2$, the number subtracted is again reduced by 1 (from 2 to 1), resulting in 2.
- In the fourth line, $3-0=3$, the number subtracted is again reduced by 1 (from 1 to 0), resulting in 3.

Following this pattern, the next line should subtract -1 from 3, as it is 1 less than the previous subtracted number (which was 0).

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of 6 eggs each can be filled with a total of 94 eggs. This requires dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each box can hold and then rounding up to the next whole number because you cannot have a fraction of a box.

Step 1: Divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per box.
\[ \frac{94}{6} = 15 \text{ remainder } 4 \]

Step 2: Since we have a remainder, we know that 15 boxes will not be enough to hold all 94 eggs. We need one more box to hold the remaining 4 eggs.

So, the smallest number of boxes Kim needs to pack all the eggs is 15 boxes plus 1 additional box.

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 4 is their least common multiple, which is 12. We then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12:

$\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{4}{12}$

$\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{3}{12}$

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

$\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4 - 3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$

Looking at the options, we can see that option [C] $\frac{3-4}{3 \times 4}$ represents the correct method for finding the difference between $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$, as it shows the numerators being subtracted and the denominators being multiplied to find the common denominator.

Thought process and reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to find a pattern or relationship between the height of the bush and the length of its shadow. From the table, we can see that as the height of the bush increases, the shadow length also increases. Let's see if there is a constant ratio between the height of the bush and the shadow length.

For the first row, the ratio of height to shadow length is \( \frac{20}{16} \).
For the second row, the ratio is \( \frac{40}{32} \).
For the third row, the ratio is \( \frac{60}{48} \).
For the fourth row, the ratio is \( \frac{80}{64} \).

Simplifying these ratios, we find that they all simplify to \( \frac{5}{4} \). This means that for every 5 cm increase in bush height, the shadow length increases by 4 cm.

Now, to find the shadow length of a bush that is 50 cm tall, we can use this ratio. Since 40 cm of bush height corresponds to 32 cm of shadow length, we can find the additional shadow length for the extra 10 cm of bush height by using the ratio \( \frac{5}{4} \).

The additional shadow length for 10 cm of bush height is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 10 \) cm = 8 cm.

So, the total shadow length for a 50 cm tall bush is 32 cm + 8 cm = 40 cm.

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the expression $2x + 3x$ represents the sum of two terms that are both multiples of $x$. The expression simplifies to $5x$, which means we are looking for a representation that combines lengths or areas to give us a total that is five times a certain unit $x$.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. The length of this segment: The segment is divided into two parts, one labeled $x$ and the other labeled $5$. This does not represent $5x$ because the two parts are not like terms; one is $x$ and the other is a constant $5$.

B. The length of this segment: The segment is divided into three parts, two labeled $2$ and $3$, and the third labeled $x$. This represents $2 + 3 + x$, which is not the same as $5x$ because $2$ and $3$ are constants, not multiples of $x$.

C. The area of this figure: The figure is a rectangle divided into two parts, one labeled $2$ and the other labeled $3$, with the height of the rectangle labeled $x$. The area of this figure would be the sum of the areas of the two parts, which are $2x$ and $3x$, respectively. Adding these gives us $2x + 3x = 5x$, which matches our expression.

D. The area of this figure: The figure is a rectangle divided into two equal parts, each labeled $x$, with the height of the rectangle labeled $5$. The area of this figure would be $5x + 5x = 10x$, which is not the same as $5x$.

Based on this analysis, the correct representation of the expression $2x + 3x$ is:

To complete the table, we need to determine the number of red tiles for the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes.

We can observe that the number of black tiles seems to follow a pattern; it is the square of the number of the shape's side length minus two:

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is $1$ black tile, which is $2^2 - 3$.
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are $4$ black tiles, which is $3^2 - 5$.
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are $9$ black tiles, which is $4^2 - 7$.

Following this pattern:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, we expect $5^2 - 9 = 16$ black tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, we expect $6^2 - 11 = 25$ black tiles.

The total number of tiles is the square of the side length of the shape:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, there are $6^2 = 36$ total tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, there are $7^2 = 49$ total tiles.

Now we can calculate the number of red tiles by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, there are $36 - 16 = 20$ red tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, there are $49 - 25 = 24$ red tiles.

Therefore, the completed table is:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & Number of Black Tiles & Number of Red Tiles & Total Number of Tiles \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

For the $6 \times 6$ shape, there are 16 black tiles and 20 red tiles.
For the $7 \times 7$ shape, there are 25 black tiles and 24 red tiles.

\section{M032760A}
To solve this problem, we first need to recognize the pattern in the number of black and red tiles in each of the square shapes that Pat made.

From the information provided and the image, we can see that the black tiles form a smaller square within the larger square made of both red and black tiles. For the $3 \times 3$ square, there is $1 \times 1$ black square in the center. For the $4 \times 4$ square, there is a $2 \times 2$ black square, and for the $5 \times 5$ square, there is a $3 \times 3$ black square.

The pattern indicates that the number of black tiles in each shape is the square of the number of tiles on one side of the black square minus one. For example, in the $5 \times 5$ shape, the black square is $3 \times 3$, so there are $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

Since Pat made a shape with a total of 64 tiles, we can deduce that this shape is an $8 \times 8$ square because $8^2 = 64$. According to the pattern, the number of black tiles will be the square of (side length of the black square minus one). For an $8 \times 8$ square, the black square would be $7 \times 7$ because the pattern shows that the black square's side length is always one less than the total square's side length.

Hence, the number of black tiles is $7^2 = 49$.

To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:
Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 64 - 49
Number of red tiles = 15

Therefore, in the shape with a total of 64 tiles, there are 49 black tiles and 15 red tiles.

Answer:
- Number of black tiles: [49]
- Number of red tiles: [15]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
To solve this problem, we first need to identify the pattern in the number of black tiles and the total number of tiles in each shape:

- In the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile.
- In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles.
- In the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles.

We can see that the number of black tiles follows a pattern where the number of black tiles is the square of the side length of the shape minus 2. This is because the number of black tiles is equal to the number of tiles along one side of the square (the center row or column), which is the side length, and then we subtract the corner tile, which is red, twice (once for the row count and once for the column count).

So for a $3 \times 3$ shape, the side length is 3, and the number of black tiles is $3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7$, but since the center tile is also black, we subtract one more, resulting in 1 black tile.

For a $4 \times 4$ shape, the side length is 4, and the number of black tiles is $4^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14$, but the center 2x2 tiles are all black, adding 3 more black tiles, resulting in 4 black tiles.

For a $5 \times 5$ shape, the side length is 5, and the number of black tiles is $5^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23$, but the center 3x3 tiles include 5 black tiles, so we add 4 more black tiles, resulting in 9 black tiles.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that for a shape with 49 black tiles, the shape must be a $7 \times 7$ square (since $7^2 = 49$).

The total number of tiles in a $7 \times 7$ square is $7^2 = 49$ black tiles plus the red tiles. To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the black tiles from the total number of tiles:

The total number of tiles in a $7 \times 7$ square is $7 \times 7 = 49$ tiles. Since all of these are black, there are no red tiles.

Therefore, Pat used 0 red tiles in the shape with 49 black tiles.

[provide your short answer]: 0 red tiles.

To complete the line for the shape $n \times n$ in the table, we need to find expressions for the number of red tiles and total number of tiles.

We are given the expression for the number of black tiles as $(n-2)^{2}$. This makes sense because the pattern indicates that the black tiles form a smaller square inside the larger $n \times n$ square, which is reduced by 2 tiles on each side (one tile from the top and one from the bottom, or one from the left and one from the right).

1. To find the total number of tiles, we simply calculate the area of the $n \times n$ square, which is $n^2$.

2. To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles. Since the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^{2}$, the number of red tiles would be $n^2 - (n-2)^{2}$.

Let's simplify the expression for the red tiles:
\[ n^2 - (n-2)^{2} = n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4 = 4n - 4 \]

So, the completed line for the shape $n \times n$ in the table would be:

\[

To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply the length by the width. In this case, the length is given as \(x + 2\) and the width is given as \(x\).

So, the area \(A\) of the rectangle can be calculated as:

\[ A = (x + 2) \times x \]
\[ A = x \times x + 2 \times x \]

2. Thought process and reasoning:
To solve the inequality $9x - 6 < 4x + 4$, we need to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the inequality. Here are the steps to achieve that:

- First, subtract $4x$ from both sides of the inequality to get all the $x$ terms on one side and the constants on the other side:
\[9x - 6 - 4x < 4x + 4 - 4x\]
\[5x - 6 < 4\]

- Next, add $6$ to both sides of the inequality to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
\[5x - 6 + 6 < 4 + 6\]
\[5x < 10\]

- Finally, divide both sides by $5$ to solve for $x$:
\[\frac{5x}{5} < \frac{10}{5}\]
\[x < 2\]

So the solution to the inequality is $x < 2$.

To determine the next term in the pattern, we need to look at how the sequence is changing from one term to the next. Let's analyze the given terms:

1. The first term is $\frac{1}{2}$.
2. The second term is $\frac{2}{3}$.
3. The third term is $\frac{3}{4}$.
4. The fourth term is $\frac{4}{5}$.
5. The fifth term is $\frac{5}{6}$.

By examining the numerators and denominators separately, we can see that for each term, the numerator is one less than the denominator. Also, as we move from one term to the next, both the numerator and denominator increase by 1.

Given that the last term we have is $\frac{5}{6}$, if we continue the pattern by increasing both the numerator and denominator by 1, the next term would be $\frac{6}{7}$.

2. The given sequence seems to be fractions where the numerator is one less than the denominator. The pattern starts with $\frac{1}{2}$ and increases by $\frac{1}{1}$ each time for the numerator and denominator. To find the 100th term, we can apply this pattern. The first term has a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2, the second term has a numerator of 2 and a denominator of 3, and so on. This pattern suggests that the numerator is always one less than the denominator.

To find the 100th term, we would have a numerator that is 99 (since it's always 1 less than the denominator) and a denominator of 100 (since it's the 100th term). Therefore, the 100th term would be $\frac{99}{100}$.

\section{M042228}
This is a free-text response question that involves identifying a pattern in the given numbers and using that pattern to determine the value of $x$.

To solve this, let's examine the pattern of numbers:

- In the top row, the numbers increase by 2 each time: 2, 4, 6, 8.
- In the left column, the numbers increase by 4 each time: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 (if we continue the pattern).
- The bottom number, 40, seems to be related to the numbers above it. It is the sum of the numbers in the third column: 6 + 14 + 20 (if we assume the pattern of adding 4 continues).

So, if we continue the pattern of adding 4 to each number in the left column, we get the following sequence: 2, 6, 10, 14, and adding 4 to 14 gives us 18.

Now, we can check if 18 fits the pattern by adding it to the sum of the numbers in the third column: 6 + 14 + 18 = 38, which does not equal 40.

However, if we consider the middle column (4, 10, x), and see that the difference between 4 and 10 is 6, if we add 6 to 10, we get 16. If we then add 16 to the sum of the numbers in the middle column, we should get 40: 4 + 10 + 16 = 30, which again does not equal 40.

So, it seems that the pattern is not simply adding a constant number to the previous one. Let's look at the differences between the numbers in the columns and rows:

- Top row: 2, 4, 6, 8 (difference of 2 between each number)
- Left column: 2, 6, 10, 14 (difference of 4 between each number)
- Middle column: 4, 10, x (difference is not clear)

If we look at the first and second column, the differences between the numbers in the first and second columns are 2 (4-2), 4 (10-6), and presumably, the next difference should be 6 (x-14). If this is the case, then x should be 14 + 6 = 20.

Let's verify this with the sum in the third column: 6 + 14 + 20 = 40, which matches the given number at the bottom.

Therefore, the value of $x$ is 20.

To solve the system of equations, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I will use the elimination method.

Step 1: Align the equations:
\(x + y = 12\)
\(2x + 5y = 36\)

Step 2: Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of x with the second equation:
\(2x + 2y = 24\)
\(2x + 5y = 36\)

Step 3: Subtract the first new equation from the second to eliminate x:
\((2x + 5y) - (2x + 2y) = 36 - 24\)
\(3y = 12\)

Step 4: Solve for y:
\(y = \frac{12}{3}\)
\(y = 4\)

Step 5: Substitute y back into the first original equation to solve for x:
\(x + 4 = 12\)
\(x = 12 - 4\)
\(x = 8\)

Step 6: Check the solution in the second original equation:
\(2x + 5y = 36\)
\(2(8) + 5(4) = 36\)
\(16 + 20 = 36\)
\(36 = 36\) (This confirms that the solution is correct.)

To solve this problem, we need to combine like terms. The like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power. 

Step 1: Identify like terms. In this case, $3p^2$ and $2p^2$ are like terms because they both have $p^2$. Similarly, $2p$ and $p$ are like terms because they both have $p$.

Step 2: Combine like terms. We add the coefficients of like terms together:
- For $p^2$ terms: $3p^2 + 2p^2 = 5p^2$
- For $p$ terms: $2p + p = 3p$

Step 3: Write the combined expression. So, $3p^2 + 2p^2 + 2p + p = 5p^2 + 3p$

Step 4: Match the combined expression to the given options. The combined expression $5p^2 + 3p$ matches option [C].

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
1. Substitute into [A]: $0 + (-1) = -1$ which simplifies to $-1 = -1$ (True)
2. Substitute into [B]: $2(0) + (-1) = 5$ which simplifies to $-1 = 5$ (False)

For the second pair $(1,3)$:
1. Substitute into [A]: $1 + 3 = -1$ which simplifies to $4 = -1$ (False)
2. Substitute into [B]: $2(1) + 3 = 5$ which simplifies to $5 = 5$ (True)
3. Substitute into [C]: $3(1) - 3 = 0$ which simplifies to $0 = 0$ (True)
4. Substitute into [D]: $4(1) - 3 = 1$ which simplifies to $1 = 1$ (True)

Now we need to find the equation that is true for both pairs. From the above, we can see that only equation [B] is true for both pairs $(0,-1)$ and $(1,3)$.

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, we need to calculate the total area of the garden and subtract the area of the path.

Step 1: Calculate the total area of the garden.
The total area of the garden is the length times the width, which is \( x \times (x + 4) \) meters. This simplifies to \( x^2 + 4x \) square meters.

Step 2: Calculate the area of the path.
The path is 1 meter wide and runs the entire length of the garden, which is \( x + 4 \) meters. Therefore, the area of the path is \( 1 \times (x + 4) \) meters, which simplifies to \( x + 4 \) square meters.

Step 3: Subtract the area of the path from the total area of the garden to get the area of the shaded portion.
So, the area of the shaded portion is \( (x^2 + 4x) - (x + 4) \) square meters. Simplifying this expression gives us \( x^2 + 4x - x - 4 \), which is \( x^2 + 3x - 4 \) square meters.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the options provided, as none of the options match the calculated expression \( x^2 + 3x - 4 \). It is possible that there is a typo in the options or in the problem setup. Given the options provided, the closest one to the correct expression is:

To solve this, we need to determine the dimensions of the hole in terms of the number of cubes that would fit into it. By looking at the image, we can see that the hole extends through the shape. We can count the visible cubes that make up the length and width of the hole on the top layer.

The length of the hole is 3 cubes long, and the width is 2 cubes wide. Since the hole goes all the way through, the depth is also 3 cubes deep (as it matches the length of the hole).

To find the number of cubes that would be needed to fill the hole, we multiply the length, width, and depth:

Number of cubes = length × width × depth
Number of cubes = 3 × 2 × 3
Number of cubes = 18

To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between the midpoints of segments AB and BC. 

Step 1: Find the midpoint of AB. Since AB is 10 cm, the midpoint of AB is 5 cm from A and 5 cm from B.

Step 2: Find the midpoint of BC. Since BC is 5.2 cm, the midpoint of BC is 2.6 cm from B and 2.6 cm from C.

Step 3: Calculate the distance between the midpoints. The distance from the midpoint of AB to B is 5 cm, and the distance from B to the midpoint of BC is 2.6 cm. Since B is between the two midpoints, we can add these distances to find the total distance between the midpoints.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total degrees the minute hand turns from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

Step 1: Understand that the minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$, every hour.

Step 2: Calculate the degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. Since the minute hand is at the 4 on the clock at 6:20, it has to complete 2/3 of a full circle to get back to the 12 at 7:00 a.m. (as each hour mark represents 1/12 of the clock face, and 4 to 12 covers 8 out of 12 hour marks). So, $2/3$ of $360^{\circ}$ is $240^{\circ}$.

Step 3: Calculate the degrees turned from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. This is a full hour, so the minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$.

Step 4: Add the degrees from step 2 and step 3 to get the total degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. So, $240^{\circ} + 360^{\circ} = 600^{\circ}$.

2. Thought process and reasoning:
To determine if triangle $PQR$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, if $PQR$ is a right triangle with $PQ$ and $QR$ being the two legs and $PR$ being the hypotenuse, then the lengths should satisfy the equation $PQ^2 + QR^2 = PR^2$.

Let's evaluate the options:

[A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$: This option suggests that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (3 cm and 4 cm) is equal to the square of the longest side (5 cm). This is the Pythagorean theorem, and if this equation is true, it confirms that triangle $PQR$ is a right triangle.

[B] $5<3+4$: This option states that the length of the longest side is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. This is a condition that must be satisfied for any triangle to exist (triangle inequality), but it does not specifically confirm a right triangle.

[C] $3+4=12-5$: This option simply states that the sum of the lengths of two sides is equal to a certain number (7 in this case), which is unrelated to determining if the triangle is a right triangle.

[D] $3>5-4$: This option states that one side is greater than the difference between the lengths of the other two sides. This is another aspect of the triangle inequality, which again does not confirm a right triangle.

3. Answer:
To confirm that $PQR$ is a right triangle, we need to check if the Pythagorean theorem holds. Computing the squares of the sides gives us $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$, and $5^2 = 25$. Adding the squares of the two shorter sides, we get $9 + 16 = 25$, which is indeed equal to the square of the longest side. Therefore, option [A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$ is the correct reason that triangle $PQR$ is a right angle triangle.

Answer: [A].

This is a multiple-choice question.

To find the area of the shaded region, we first need to calculate the area of the entire rectangle and then subtract the area of the white triangle.

The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 16 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Next, we calculate the area of the white triangle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \, \text{cm}^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Now, subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region:
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of rectangle} - \text{Area of triangle} \]
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 - 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 72 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

2. The dotted line indicates where the paper is cut. Since the paper is folded, cutting along this line will produce two identical shapes that are mirror images of each other.
3. The line is drawn diagonally from one corner of the folded paper to a point on the opposite side, 1 cm from the adjacent corner. This suggests that the cut will create two identical triangles.
4. The triangles will have two equal sides: the 4 cm side (height of the paper) and the hypotenuse (the cut along the dotted line). The base of each triangle will be 1 cm, which is shorter than the other two sides.
5. Since the two sides (4 cm and the hypotenuse) are equal and the base (1 cm) is different, the triangles are isosceles.

The question asks for the sum of all the interior angles of a pentagon, which is a polygon with five sides. To find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon, we can use the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°

where n is the number of sides in the polygon.

For a pentagon (n = 5), we can plug in the value of n into the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 3 × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 540°

Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of pentagon $ABCDE$ is 540 degrees.

To solve this, we need to visualize rotating the given shape 180 degrees (a half-turn) clockwise around point O.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:

1. A half-turn (180 degrees) rotation will flip the shape to the opposite quadrant.
2. Since the original shape is in the upper right quadrant, it will end up in the lower left quadrant after a half-turn.
3. The orientation of the shape will also be reversed; the tip of the triangle that points to the right will point to the left after the rotation.
4. The base of the triangle that is currently horizontal will remain horizontal after the rotation.

Looking at the options:

- Option A shows the triangle in the upper left quadrant, which is not the result of a half-turn from the upper right quadrant.
- Option B shows the triangle in the lower right quadrant, which is also incorrect.
- Option C shows the triangle in the upper right quadrant, which is the original position, not the result of a rotation.
- Option D shows the triangle in the lower left quadrant with the tip pointing to the left and the base horizontal, which matches the expected result of a half-turn clockwise rotation.

Since I'm unable to physically mark points or draw on images, I will guide you through the steps of how to do it:

1. To mark the point $B(3,30^{\circ})$ on the graph:
   - Find the 30° line on the circular grid (which is the first line to the right of the vertical 0°/360° line).
   - Count 3 circles out from the origin, O, along the 30° line.
   - Mark the point B there.

2. To mark the point $C(4,120^{\circ})$ on the graph:
   - Find the 120° line on the circular grid (which is the third line to the right of the vertical 90° line).
   - Count 4 circles out from the origin, O, along the 120° line.
   - Mark the point C there.

For drawing the angle $BOC$:
   - Connect point B to the origin, O, and then connect point O to point C, forming an angle at point O.

To measure the angle $BOC$:
   - The angle $BOC$ is the difference in the angles from the baseline OA to OB and from OA to OC.
   - Since OB is at 30° and OC is at 120°, subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle.
   - $120° - 30° = 90°$.

Therefore, the measure of angle $BOC$ is $90°$.

Step by step reasoning:
1. The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.
2. The perimeter given is 36 cm. So, one side of the square is \( \frac{36 \mathrm{~cm}}{4} = 9 \mathrm{~cm} \).
3. The area of a square is found by squaring the length of one side. So, the area is \( 9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \).

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

This question is a free-text response type.

Step 1: Identify the type of triangle.
The information given indicates that AC = BC, which means triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with the two legs (AC and BC) being equal.

Step 2: Analyze the relationship between AB and CX.
AB is twice as long as CX. Since CX is perpendicular to AB and bisects it (as it appears from the diagram, although this is not stated), this means that AX is equal to XB, and each is twice the length of CX.

Step 3: Use the properties of an isosceles triangle.
In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore, angle ACB is equal to angle ABC.

Step 4: Calculate angle B.
Since angle ACB is equal to angle ABC, and they are the base angles of the isosceles triangle, and since the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up the equation:

Let angle B = angle ABC = angle ACB.

Since CX is perpendicular to AB, angle CXB is a right angle, which is 90 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle ACB, the sum of angles is:
angle ACB + angle ABC + angle CAB = 180 degrees
B + B + 90 = 180
2B + 90 = 180
2B = 180 - 90
2B = 90
B = 90 / 2
B = 45 degrees

Answer: [45 degrees].

This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( b \), we need to use the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal. The given angles of 60° and 70° are consecutive interior angles, also known as co-interior angles, which are on the same side of the transversal.

The property of consecutive interior angles states that when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary, which means their sum is 180°.

Given the angle of 70°, we can find the value of \( b \) by subtracting this angle from 180°:

\[ b = 180° - 70° \]
\[ b = 110° \]

Answer: [110°].

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of Peter getting a pink candy after Megan has already gotten one. Initially, there were an equal number of each color candy, so the probability of getting a pink candy was 1/4 (since there are four colors).

After Megan gets a pink candy, there is one less pink candy in the machine, but the total number of candies has also decreased by one. Assuming there were an equal number of each color to begin with, and there were 100 candies in total, there would have been 25 candies of each color. After Megan's turn, there would be 24 pink candies left and 99 candies in total.

The new probability of getting a pink candy for Peter is 24/99.

Since 24/99 is less than 25/100, the probability of Peter getting a pink candy is less than the probability of Megan getting a pink candy.

Answer: [D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

To determine by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, as it represents the actual car production by NU Car Motor Company during the day.

1. Locate the point on the y-axis that corresponds to 150 cars produced.
2. Move horizontally from this point until you intersect with the solid line on the graph.
3. From the point of intersection, move vertically down to the x-axis to find the time.

Looking at the graph, the solid line intersects the 150 cars produced level somewhere between 11 am and 12 noon. It appears that the intersection is closer to 12 noon than to 11 am. However, it is not exactly at 12 noon. The intersection point is slightly before 12 noon.

Given the resolution of the graph, it is challenging to pinpoint the precise time, but it appears to be around 11:50 am or slightly before that time.

Answer: [around 11:50 am].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
To calculate the average number of cars produced per hour on this day by the NU Car Motor Company, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, which represents the actual car production.

First, we need to determine the total number of cars produced by the end of the day. At 4 pm, the graph shows that the total number of cars produced is just under 400. For the purposes of this calculation, I will assume the total number of cars produced is exactly 400, as it's very close to that number and it's difficult to determine the exact figure from the graph.

Next, we need to calculate the total time period for car production. The graph starts at 8 am and ends at 4 pm, which is a span of 8 hours.

Now we can calculate the average number of cars produced per hour by dividing the total number of cars produced by the total number of hours.

Average number of cars produced per hour = Total number of cars produced / Total number of hours
Average number of cars produced per hour = 400 cars / 8 hours

Now we perform the division:

Average number of cars produced per hour = 50 cars per hour

So the average number of cars produced per hour on this day was 50.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681C}
To determine during which hour the most cars were produced by the NU Car Motor Company, as shown by the solid line on the graph, you need to look for the hour during which the solid line has the steepest slope because that indicates the greatest increase in the number of cars produced from the start to the end of that hour.

By examining the graph, you can see that the solid line has the steepest slope between 2 pm and 3 pm. This means that the production rate of cars was the highest during that hour compared to any other hour in the day.

Answer: [Between 2 pm and 3 pm].

This is a multiple choice question.

To solve this problem, we need to estimate the rate of change in sales for each type of soft drink and then project when the sales of Cherry Cola will equal the sales of Lemon Cola.

Looking at the graph, we can see that Cherry Cola's sales are increasing each year, while Lemon Cola's sales are decreasing. We need to estimate the annual change in sales for each.

For Cherry Cola:
- From 1998 to 1999, sales increased by approximately 10 million cans.
- From 1999 to 2000, sales increased by approximately 10 million cans again.
- From 2000 to 2001, sales increased by approximately 10 million cans once more.

It appears that Cherry Cola's sales are increasing by about 10 million cans per year.

For Lemon Cola:
- From 1998 to 1999, sales decreased by approximately 5 million cans.
- From 1999 to 2000, sales decreased by approximately 5 million cans again.
- From 2000 to 2001, sales decreased by approximately 5 million cans once more.

It appears that Lemon Cola's sales are decreasing by about 5 million cans per year.

In 2001, the sales of Cherry Cola were about 30 million cans, and the sales of Lemon Cola were about 50 million cans. The difference in sales is 20 million cans.

Since Cherry Cola's sales are increasing by 10 million cans per year and Lemon Cola's sales are decreasing by 5 million cans per year, the gap closes by 15 million cans each year (10 million increase for Cherry Cola + 5 million decrease for Lemon Cola).

To find out how many years it will take for the sales to be equal, we divide the difference in sales by the annual closing gap:

20 million cans / 15 million cans per year = 1.33 years

Since we can't have a fraction of a year in this context, we round up to the next whole year. Therefore, it will take approximately 2 years from 2001 for the sales to be equal.

2001 + 2 years = 2003

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing either a blue button or a white button from the bag. The total number of buttons in the bag is the sum of red, blue, and white buttons, which is 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 buttons.

The number of favorable outcomes for drawing a blue button is 8, and for drawing a white button is 4. Since these are mutually exclusive events (a button cannot be both blue and white), we can add the probabilities of each event to find the total probability of drawing either a blue or white button.

The probability of drawing a blue button is the number of blue buttons divided by the total number of buttons, which is 8/22. The probability of drawing a white button is the number of white buttons divided by the total number of buttons, which is 4/22. 

Adding these probabilities together gives us the total probability of drawing either a blue or white button:
8/22 + 4/22 = 12/22

Answer: [D] $\frac{12}{22}$

\section{M042207}
This is a drawing type question where you need to complete and label a pie chart based on the given data.

To complete the pie chart, you should calculate the percentage of the pie chart that each sport represents based on the number of students who favor it. Since there are 480 students in total, you can calculate the percentage for each sport by dividing the number of students who favor that sport by the total number of students and then multiplying by 100.

Here are the steps to complete the drawing:

1. Calculate the percentage for each sport:
   - Hockey: (60 / 480) * 100 = 12.5%
   - Football: (180 / 480) * 100 = 37.5%
   - Tennis: (120 / 480) * 100 = 25%
   - Basketball: (120 / 480) * 100 = 25%

2. Since a pie chart represents 100% of the data and a circle has 360 degrees, you can find the number of degrees for each sport by multiplying its percentage by 3.6 (because 360 degrees / 100% = 3.6 degrees per percent).
   - Hockey: 12.5% * 3.6 = 45 degrees
   - Football: 37.5% * 3.6 = 135 degrees
   - Tennis: 25% * 3.6 = 90 degrees
   - Basketball: 25% * 3.6 = 90 degrees

3. Use these degree measurements to divide the pie chart accordingly. For example, if you start at the top and work clockwise:
   - Hockey would be a 45-degree section.
   - Football would take up the next 135 degrees.
   - Tennis would be the following 90-degree section.
   - Basketball would be the last 90-degree section.

4. Label each section with the name of the sport and the corresponding percentage or number of students.

Unfortunately, I cannot physically draw on the image to demonstrate these steps, but this explanation should guide you in completing the pie chart accurately.

To determine which statement must be true based on the given information, let's analyze each option:

[A] This statement cannot be confirmed as true just from the average lengths. Even though Team B has a higher average, it doesn't necessarily mean that each individual on Team B jumped farther than all individuals on Team A.

[B] This statement is similar to [A] and also cannot be confirmed as true just from the average lengths. It's possible that some students on Team A jumped farther than some on Team B, but the overall average for Team B was higher.

[C] This statement is true. If both teams had the same number of students and Team B's average jump length was higher, then the total distance jumped by Team B as a group would be greater than that of Team A.

[D] This statement could be true, but it is not guaranteed. Without specific data on each student's jump length, we cannot confirm that some students in Team A jumped farther than some in Team B.

The only statement that must be true based on the given information is that as a group, Team B jumped farther than Team A because the average jump length for Team B is higher and both teams had the same number of students.

Answer: [C] As a group, team B jumped farther than team A.

To solve this problem, we need to understand that since Sue puts the marble back into the bag, the second draw is independent of the first draw. This means that the probability of drawing a red marble the second time is the same as the probability of drawing a red marble the first time.

There are 5 red marbles out of a total of 10 marbles. So the probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is:

\section{M052503A}
The age structure of a country can have a significant impact on its population growth. In the graphs provided, we can analyze the population distribution of Country X and Country Y to understand why Country X might experience more rapid population growth than Country Y.

Country X has a much larger base of the youngest age group (ages 0-19), which is labeled as "Going to have children." This indicates that there is a high number of young individuals who will enter their reproductive years in the near future. As these individuals grow older and start families, they will contribute to a higher birth rate and, consequently, a more rapid population growth.

In contrast, Country Y has a narrower base for the youngest age group and a relatively larger population in the age group labeled as "Finished having children" (ages 45-89). This suggests that a smaller proportion of the population is in their prime childbearing years (ages 20-44), which would result in a lower birth rate and slower population growth.

Additionally, the age group of 20-44 in Country X, which represents those who are currently in their childbearing years, is substantially larger than that of Country Y. This means that not only is there a larger upcoming generation to continue the growth, but the current generation is also more capable of sustaining high birth rates.

In summary, the broader base of the pyramid for Country X indicates a large young population that will soon be entering their reproductive years, while Country Y's population pyramid shows a shrinking base, indicating a smaller young population to sustain growth. This difference in age distribution is why Country X would likely have more rapid population growth than Country Y.

This is a multiple choice question.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given by the two balance scale images.

From the first image, we can see that one block is heavier than 8 grams because the side with the block is lower than the side with the 8 grams.

From the second image, we can see that three blocks together are lighter than 20 grams because the side with the blocks is higher than the side with the 20 grams.

Now let's consider the options given:

[A] If one block weighs 5 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 5 = 15\) grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image, but it contradicts the first image because 5 grams is less than 8 grams, and the first image shows the block is heavier than 8 grams.

[B] If one block weighs 6 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 6 = 18\) grams, which is also less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image, and it is also consistent with the first image because 6 grams is less than 8 grams, but the block is shown to be heavier than 8 grams, so this option cannot be correct.

[C] If one block weighs 7 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 7 = 21\) grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image, where three blocks are lighter than 20 grams.

[D] If one block weighs 8 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 8 = 24\) grams, which is also more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image, where three blocks are lighter than 20 grams.

The only option that fits the information from both images is [A] $5 \mathrm{~g}$, even though it contradicts the first image. However, since none of the other options fit the second image, and we know that the blocks must weigh less than 8 grams each, we might suspect there's an error in the interpretation of the images or the question itself.

Given the options and the images, we are forced to make an educated guess. Since none of the options perfectly fit the scenario described by the images, we should choose the one that comes closest to fitting the conditions:

Answer: [A] $5 \mathrm{~g}$ (with the caveat that there seems to be an inconsistency in the provided images and the question).

To solve this problem, we can express the total length of the wood as the sum of the lengths of the three pieces and set that equal to the original length of the wood. Then we can solve for \(x\), and afterwards determine the longest piece by comparing the lengths of each piece.

Step 1: Write the equation representing the sum of the lengths of the three pieces equal to the total length of the wood.
\[ 2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40 \]

Step 2: Simplify and solve for \(x\).
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Step 3: Substitute \(x\) back into the expressions for each piece to find their lengths.
\[ 2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \]
\[ x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \]
\[ x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \]

Step 4: Determine the longest piece.
The lengths are 11 cm, 15 cm, and 14 cm. The longest piece is the one measuring 15 cm.

This problem involves calculating the volume of the box and the volume of a single book to determine how many books can fit into the box. To find the largest number of books that can fit, we need to optimize the orientation of the books to use the space most efficiently.

1. Calculate the volume of the box:
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = 36 \, \text{cm} \times 30 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = 21600 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

2. Calculate the volume of a single book:
\[ \text{Volume of a book} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of a book} = 20 \, \text{cm} \times 15 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of a book} = 1800 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

3. Determine the number of books that can fit into the box:
\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Volume of the box}}{\text{Volume of a book}} \]
\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{21600 \, \text{cm}^3}{1800 \, \text{cm}^3} \]
\[ \text{Number of books} = 12 \]

However, we must also consider the dimensions of the books relative to the box to ensure they fit properly. The books should be placed in a way that their dimensions align with the dimensions of the box, without any space wasted.

Given the dimensions of the box and the book, we can fit the books in the following ways:
- 2 books along the 36 cm side (2 x 15 cm = 30 cm, with 6 cm of space remaining)
- 2 books along the 30 cm side (2 x 15 cm = 30 cm, perfectly fitting)
- 3 books along the 20 cm height (3 x 6 cm = 18 cm, with 2 cm of space remaining)

So, we can fit 2 books along the length, 2 books along the width, and 3 books in height, for a total of:
\[ 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12 \text{ books} \]

The largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 12.

The image shows two population pyramids comparing the age structure between Country X and Country Y. Population pyramids are graphical illustrations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population, typically broken down by gender. The shape of the pyramid can provide insights into the growth rate of the population, as well as potential social and economic challenges.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for the following reasons:

1. The shape of Country Y's pyramid indicates slow growth, with a smaller base and a relatively larger proportion of the population in the older age groups (45-89 years). This suggests an aging population with fewer younger people relative to the elderly.

2. In contrast, Country X's pyramid has a broad base, indicating a large population of young people (0-19 years). This suggests rapid growth and a higher ratio of young to old, which could potentially provide a larger workforce to support the elderly.

3. The relative sizes of the age cohorts in Country Y's pyramid suggest that as the current middle-aged population (20-44 years) ages, there will be proportionately fewer people in the working-age population to support them, potentially leading to a higher dependency ratio.

In summary, Country Y's population structure suggests an aging population with a smaller younger generation to support the older generation, potentially leading to greater social and economic challenges related to caring for the elderly.

To solve this problem, we can use the table provided to express each of the given numbers as a power of 4 and then use the properties of exponents to find the product.

Step 1: Identify the powers of 4 that correspond to 256 and 4,096 in the table.
- From the table, we see that $256 = 4^{4}$.
- From the table, we also see that $4,096 = 4^{6}$.

Step 2: Use the properties of exponents to multiply the two powers of 4.
- When multiplying powers with the same base, we add the exponents: $4^{m} \times 4^{n} = 4^{m+n}$.

Step 3: Apply the property to the given numbers.
- We have $4^{4} \times 4^{6} = 4^{4+6} = 4^{10}$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the original pipe before the workman cut off $\frac{1}{5}$ of it. Since we know that the piece he cut off is 3 meters long and it represents $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original length, we can set up the following equation:

Let $x$ be the length of the original pipe. Then, $\frac{1}{5}x = 3$ meters.

To find $x$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

$x = 3 \times 5$

$x = 15$

Therefore, the original pipe was 15 meters long.

Step by step reasoning:

[A] To find $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$, you multiply $50$ by $\frac{3}{10}$, which equals $5 \times 3 = 15$. To find $50\%$ of $3$, you multiply $3$ by $0.5$ (since $50\%$ is the same as $0.5$), which equals $1.5$. Since $15$ is not equal to $1.5$, option [A] is not true.

[B] To find $3\%$ of $50$, you multiply $50$ by $0.03$ (since $3\%$ is the same as $0.03$), which equals $1.5$. To find $6\%$ of $100$, you multiply $100$ by $0.06$ (since $6\%$ is the same as $0.06$), which equals $6$. Since $1.5$ is not equal to $6$, option [B] is not true.

[C] To find $50 \div 30$, you divide $50$ by $30$, which equals $\frac{5}{3}$ or approximately $1.6667$. To find $30 \div 50$, you divide $30$ by $50$, which equals $\frac{3}{5}$ or $0.6$. Since $\frac{5}{3}$ is not equal to $\frac{3}{5}$, option [C] is not true.

[D] To find $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$, you multiply $50$ by $\frac{3}{10}$, which equals $5 \times 3 = 15$. To find $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$, you multiply $30$ by $\frac{5}{10}$, which equals $3 \times 5 = 15$. Since both expressions equal $15$, option [D] is true.

Answer: [D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$.

Type of question: Multiple choice

Thought process and reasoning:
Let's denote the three consecutive whole numbers as follows:
- The first number: $2n - 1$ (since it's one less than the middle number)
- The middle number: $2n$
- The third number: $2n + 1$ (since it's one more than the middle number)

Now, to find the sum of these three numbers, we simply add them together:
$$(2n - 1) + (2n) + (2n + 1)$$

Combining like terms, we get:
$$2n + 2n + 2n - 1 + 1$$

The $-1$ and $+1$ cancel each other out, leaving us with:
$$6n$$

Answer:
[B] $6 n$

1. This is a free text response question.

2. To simplify the expression, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions so that we can combine them. The fractions are $\frac{3x}{8}$, $\frac{x}{4}$, and $\frac{x}{2}$. 

The denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common multiple (LCM) of these denominators is 8. This means we can express all the fractions with a denominator of 8.

- For the first fraction, $\frac{3x}{8}$, the denominator is already 8, so we leave it as is.
- For the second fraction, $\frac{x}{4}$, to get a denominator of 8, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in $\frac{2x}{8}$.
- For the third fraction, $\frac{x}{2}$, to get a denominator of 8, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4, resulting in $\frac{4x}{8}$.

Now we can add the fractions:
$\frac{3x}{8} + \frac{2x}{8} + \frac{4x}{8}$.

Since they all have the same denominator, we add the numerators:
$3x + 2x + 4x = 9x$.

So the simplified expression is $\frac{9x}{8}$.

3. Answer:
[The simplified expression is $\frac{9x}{8}$.]

\section{M032760C}
From the table and the images provided, we can see that for each square shape that Pat makes, the number of black tiles forms a smaller square in the center. The pattern is as follows:

- A $3 \times 3$ shape has $1^2$ black tile (1 black tile).
- A $4 \times 4$ shape has $2^2$ black tiles (4 black tiles).
- A $5 \times 5$ shape has $3^2$ black tiles (9 black tiles).

It seems that for an $n \times n$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$. This is because in each case, the side of the black tile square is two less than the side of the entire shape.

Given that Pat used 44 red tiles to make the next shape, we first need to determine the size of the entire shape. Since the red tiles form the border around the black tiles, and for each shape, the border is one tile wide, we can deduce the size of the shape by adding the necessary tiles for the border.

For an $n \times n$ square, the number of red tiles would be $n^2 - (n-2)^2$ which simplifies to $4n - 4$ because:
\[ n^2 - (n-2)^2 = n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = 4n - 4 \]

We can set up the equation $4n - 4 = 44$ to solve for the value of $n$.

Adding 4 to both sides: $4n = 48$
Dividing by 4: $n = 12$

So, the shape is a $12 \times 12$ square. To find the number of black tiles, we calculate $(n-2)^2$:
\[ (12-2)^2 = 10^2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the $12 \times 12$ shape.

Answer: [100 black tiles].

To solve for the value of $2a + 2b + 4$, we can use the given equation $a + b = 25$. 

Step 1: Multiply the entire equation $a + b = 25$ by 2 to maintain the equality, which gives us $2a + 2b = 50$.

Step 2: Then, we add 4 to both sides of the equation to get the value of $2a + 2b + 4$. So, $2a + 2b + 4 = 50 + 4$.

Step 3: Simplify the equation to find the value, which is $2a + 2b + 4 = 54$.

\section{M032116}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the perimeter of the square, we first need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of the side by taking the square root of the area.

Step 1: Calculate the length of one side of the square.
The area of the square is \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \), so the length of one side is \( \sqrt{144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}} = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \).

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the square.
The perimeter of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side} \). Since we found that the length of one side is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \), the perimeter is \( 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).

Answer: [B] $48 \mathrm{~cm}$

\section{M032398}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of angles in triangles. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^{\circ} \).

First, let's consider the smaller triangle at the top. It has one angle that measures \( 65^{\circ} \), and the angle opposite to \( x \) is a right angle, which measures \( 90^{\circ} \). Therefore, the remaining angle, which is \( x \), can be found by subtracting the sum of the known angles from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\[ x + 65^{\circ} + 90^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x + 155^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 155^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 25^{\circ} \]

However, this value of \( x \) is not in the options provided, which suggests that there might be a mistake in the calculation. Let's look at the image again and reassess.

Upon reevaluating the image, it seems there was a mistake in the initial assessment. The angle opposite to \( x \) is not a right angle. Instead, we need to find the angle at the base of the smaller triangle, which is supplementary to the \( 65^{\circ} \) angle (since they form a straight line). Let's call this angle \( y \):

\[ y + 65^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ y = 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} \]
\[ y = 115^{\circ} \]

Now, we can find \( x \) by considering the larger triangle, which includes the \( 45^{\circ} \) angle, the \( 30^{\circ} \) angle, and the angle \( y \) we just found:

\[ x + 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + y = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x + 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + 115^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x + 190^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]

This equation is incorrect because the sum of the angles in a triangle cannot be more than \( 180^{\circ} \). The correct equation should only include the angles within the larger triangle, which are \( x \), \( 45^{\circ} \), and \( 30^{\circ} \):

\[ x + 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x + 75^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 75^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 105^{\circ} \]

This value of \( x \) is also not in the options provided, indicating another mistake. Let's try once more, focusing only on the angles within the larger triangle.

The correct approach is to subtract the sum of the two known angles within the larger triangle from \( 180^{\circ} \) to find \( x \):

\[ x + 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x + 75^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 75^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 105^{\circ} \]

Since \( 105^{\circ} \) is not one of the options, it seems there has been a mistake in interpreting the image or the angles provided. Without the correct image or additional information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer from the given options. Please check the image or the information provided to ensure accuracy.

\section{M032734}
This is a drawing type of question.

To complete the diagram showing the shape when viewed from directly above after the triangle flaps have been folded up, you would need to draw lines that represent the edges of the triangle flaps as they would appear from above.

Here are the steps to complete the drawing:

1. Start with the square in the center of the shape; this will remain unchanged because it is the base of the shape.

2. The triangular flaps, when folded up, will not be visible in their entirety from directly above. Only the edges where they touch the square will be visible.

3. To represent this, draw a line parallel to each side of the square, close to the square's sides. These lines will represent the bottom edges of the folded-up triangles.

4. The result will look like a smaller square inside the original square, with the sides of the smaller square parallel to the sides of the larger square and spaced apart by the width of the flaps.

5. Make sure that the lines inside the square do not touch the sides of the larger square; there should be a small gap representing the thickness of the cardboard.

Since I can't draw the lines for you, please imagine a smaller square inside the larger one, with each side parallel and close to the larger square's sides, to represent the folded-up flaps.

\section{M042201}
This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( x \), we need to use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

From the image, we know that the height is \( 4 \) cm and the width is \( 5 \) cm. The volume is given as \( 200 \) cm\(^3\). We can set up the equation:

\[ 200 = x \times 5 \times 4 \]

Now we simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Answer: [10 cm].

\section{M032507}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector and then apply that probability to the total number of spins.

Step 1: Count the number of sectors on the spinner. There are 5 sectors in total (Orange, Green, Blue, Red, Purple).

Step 2: Determine the probability of landing on the red sector. Since all sectors are of equal size, the probability of landing on any one sector is 1/5.

Step 3: Calculate the expected number of times the spinner will land on the red sector out of 600 spins. Multiply the total number of spins by the probability of landing on the red sector:

Expected number of red spins = Total spins * Probability of red
Expected number of red spins = 600 * (1/5)
Expected number of red spins = 600 * 0.2
Expected number of red spins = 120

However, since 120 is not one of the options provided, it seems there might be an error in the interpretation of the image or the question. Given the options, we need to make an educated guess. If we assume that the image is not to scale and that the red sector is actually smaller than the others, we would expect it to come up less frequently. Without specific information on the actual size of the red sector, we can only guess based on the provided options.

Answer: Since none of the options match the calculated expectation based on the image, and without further information, it is not possible to accurately select the correct answer. If we assume the image is not to scale and the red sector is smaller, we would choose the smallest number provided, which is:

[A] 30

\section{M032695}
To create a pie chart, we need to calculate the percentage of the total that each group represents and then convert these percentages into angles, because a full circle is 360 degrees.

Here are the calculations:

1. University: \( \frac{50}{400} \times 100\% = 12.5\% \)
2. Polytechnic: \( \frac{100}{400} \times 100\% = 25\% \)
3. Business College: \( \frac{150}{400} \times 100\% = 37.5\% \)
4. Workforce: Since these are the remainder, it's \( 100\% - (12.5\% + 25\% + 37.5\%) = 25\% \)

Now, we convert these percentages into angles:

1. University: \( 12.5\% \times 360° = 45° \)
2. Polytechnic: \( 25\% \times 360° = 90° \)
3. Business College: \( 37.5\% \times 360° = 135° \)
4. Workforce: \( 25\% \times 360° = 90° \)

Using the circle provided, we would draw lines from the center to the edge of the circle to divide it into the calculated angles. Since I cannot draw on the image, I will describe how you might proceed:

- Start at the top of the circle and draw a line from the center to the edge to establish the starting point.
- Measure a 45° angle clockwise from that line and draw another line from the center to the edge for the University segment.
- From the end of the University segment, measure a 90° angle for the Polytechnic segment.
- Next, from the end of the Polytechnic segment, measure a 135° angle for the Business College segment.
- The remaining section will be the Workforce segment, which should also be 90° if measured correctly.

Finally, label each segment accordingly:

- The smallest segment (45°) is labeled "University."
- The two equal segments (90° each) are labeled "Polytechnic" and "Workforce."
- The largest segment (135°) is labeled "Business College."

\section{M042169C}
Type of question: Free text response

Thought process and reasoning:
To answer how the increase in staff members from 30 to 50 at one restaurant would affect the median and the mean, we should first understand what the median and mean are.

The median is the middle value of a list of numbers when they are arranged in order. For the original staff numbers (12, 18, 19, 21, 30), the median is 19, as it is the third number in the ordered list.

The mean is the average of all the numbers. To find the original mean, we add all the staff numbers together and divide by the number of restaurants. So, the original mean is (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20.

Now, if the restaurant with 30 staff increases its staff to 50, the new set of numbers will be (12, 18, 19, 21, 50). The median will still be 19, as it is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order (12, 18, 19, 21, 50). Thus, the median will not change.

To find the new mean, we add the new set of staff numbers and divide by 5. The new mean will be (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

Answer:
- The median will not change; it will remain 19.
- The mean will increase from 20 to 24.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To answer this question, we need to understand what the percentages represent in the context of the election results. Pat received 80% of the votes, and Chris received 20% of the votes. This means that out of every 100 students, 80 would have voted for Pat, and 20 would have voted for Chris.

Step by step, we can reason that if a student is chosen at random, there is a higher chance that they voted for Pat because Pat received the majority of the votes. Since 80% is a large majority, it is more likely than not that a randomly chosen student voted for Pat.

Answer: [B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.
