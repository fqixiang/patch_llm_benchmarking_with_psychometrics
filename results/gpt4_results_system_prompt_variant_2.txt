2. To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Jenny gets and then subtract that amount from the total to find out how much Ann gets. 

   Since Jenny gets $\frac{3}{8}$ of the $560$ zeds, we calculate Jenny's share by multiplying the total amount of money by $\frac{3}{8}$:
   \[ Jenny's\ share = 560 \times \frac{3}{8} \]

   After calculating Jenny's share, we subtract it from the total amount to find Ann's share:
   \[ Ann's\ share = Total\ amount - Jenny's\ share \]
   \[ Ann's\ share = 560 - (560 \times \frac{3}{8}) \]

3. Now let's do the calculations:

   For Jenny's share:
   \[ 560 \times \frac{3}{8} = 70 \times 3 = 210 \]

   So Jenny gets 210 zeds.

   For Ann's share:
   \[ 560 - 210 = 350 \]

   Therefore, Ann gets 350 zeds.

Answer: [Ann gets 350 zeds.]

Type of question: Multiple choice.

To solve this, we need to add the two fractions together. Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before we can add them. The easiest common denominator to use here is 1000 since 100 is a factor of 1000. 

First, we convert $\frac{4}{100}$ to a fraction with a denominator of 1000. To do this, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to get $\frac{40}{1000}$.

Now we can add the two fractions:

$\frac{40}{1000} + \frac{3}{1000} = \frac{40 + 3}{1000} = \frac{43}{1000}$

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

$43 รท 1000 = 0.043$

Answer: [A] 0.043

\section{M032626}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, we need to break down the number 36 into its prime factors. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.

Step 1: Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if 36 is divisible by 2. 
- 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 is a prime factor.

Step 2: Continue with the number 18 and see if it can be divided by 2 again. 
- 18 divided by 2 is 9, so 2 is a prime factor again.

Step 3: Now we have 9, which is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.
- 9 divided by 3 is 3, so 3 is a prime factor.

Step 4: We are left with 3, which is a prime number itself.

So, 36 can be expressed as $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

\section{M032662}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of multiplying fractions. When two fractions that are both less than 1 are multiplied together, the result is a fraction that is smaller than either of the original fractions. This is because a fraction represents a part of a whole, and when you take a part of a part, you end up with a smaller piece.

In the first image, we see that both P and Q are between 0 and 1, which means they are both fractions less than 1. Therefore, when we multiply P by Q, the result N should be a fraction that is smaller than both P and Q.

Looking at the second image with the options:

- Option A places N to the right of 1, which would mean P * Q is greater than 1. This is not possible since both P and Q are less than 1.
- Option B places N between Q and 1, which suggests that P * Q is greater than Q. This is also not possible since P is less than 1.
- Option C places N between P and Q, which would mean P * Q is greater than P but less than Q. This is not possible since P * Q must be less than both P and Q.
- Option D places N to the left of P, which is the correct position since P * Q must be less than both P and Q.

Answer: [D].

\section{M042002}
To determine the greatest result when multiplying two two-digit numbers using the digits 3, 5, 7, and 9, we need to consider the positional value of each digit. In a two-digit number, the digit in the tens place is ten times more significant than the digit in the ones place. 

Therefore, to maximize the product of the two numbers, we should place the larger digits in the tens places of both numbers. The two largest digits we have are 9 and 7. By placing 9 in the tens place of one number and 7 in the tens place of the other, we ensure that the tens place contributes as much as possible to the overall product.

Next, we need to decide where to place the remaining digits, 5 and 3. Since we want to maximize the product, it is better to have the larger digit, which is 5, multiply with the larger tens place digit, which is 9. This way, the overall contribution of the product of the tens place and ones place is maximized.

Hence, the largest product is obtained by placing the digits as follows:

- 9 and 3 in one number, with 9 in the tens place and 3 in the ones place, making the number 93.
- 7 and 5 in the other number, with 7 in the tens place and 5 in the ones place, making the number 75.

Now, we multiply the two numbers:

93 x 75 = 6975

This is the greatest result possible with the given digits.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine which number $K$ represents on the number line, let's first analyze the number line itself. We see that the line is divided into equal segments between the whole numbers 26 and 28. Counting the number of segments between 27 and 28, there are ten segments, indicating that each segment represents a tenth (0.1) of a unit.

The mark for $K$ is eight segments to the right of 27. Since each segment represents 0.1, we can calculate the value of $K$ by adding eight tenths to 27:

\[ 27 + (8 \times 0.1) = 27 + 0.8 = 27.8 \]

Answer: [B] 27.8

\section{M042031}
1. This is a multiple choice question.

2. To find the value of the square that will make the two fractions equivalent, we need to find a common factor or a way to relate the two denominators. The denominator of the first fraction is 14, and the denominator of the second fraction is 21. We can see that 21 is divisible by 7, and 14 is also divisible by 7. If we divide 14 by 7, we get 2, and if we divide 21 by 7, we get 3. This means that the second fraction should be 3/2 times larger than the first fraction to be equivalent.

Now, we simplify the first fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This simplifies to $\frac{2}{7}$. To make an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 21, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator of $\frac{2}{7}$ by 3 (since 21 is 3 times 7). This gives us $\frac{2 \times 3}{7 \times 3} = \frac{6}{21}$.

Step 2: Check the given options to see which one matches $\frac{125}{1000}$.

[A] $\frac{125}{100}$ is equivalent to 1.25, not 0.125.
[B] $\frac{125}{1,000}$ is equivalent to 0.125, which is the decimal we started with.
[C] $\frac{125}{10,000}$ is equivalent to 0.0125, which is an order of magnitude too small.
[D] $\frac{125}{100,000}$ is equivalent to 0.00125, which is two orders of magnitude too small.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the original pipe before the workman cut off $\frac{1}{5}$ of it. Since the piece he cut off was 3 meters long and it represents $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original length, we can set up the following equation:

Let $x$ be the length of the original pipe. Then, $\frac{1}{5}x = 3$ meters.

To find $x$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate $x$:

$5 \times \frac{1}{5}x = 5 \times 3$

$x = 15$

This is a free text response question.

To complete the missing boxes, we need to calculate the percentage of successful shots for James and the number of successful shots for Andrew.

1. For James, since he made 15 successful shots out of 20, we calculate the percentage as follows:
\[ \frac{15}{20} \times 100\% = 0.75 \times 100\% = 75\% \]

2. For Andrew, since he has a success rate of 80%, we need to find out how many shots out of 20 this corresponds to. We set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{20} \times 100\% = 80\% \]
To solve for \( x \), we have:
\[ x = \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Answer:
- James' percentage of successful shots is $75 \%$.
- Andrew made $16$ out of 20 successful shots.

2. The pattern shows a sequence of subtraction operations where the first number is always 3, and the second number is decreasing by 1 each time. The results of the subtraction are as follows:

- When subtracting 3 from 3, the result is 0.
- When subtracting 2 from 3, the result is 1.
- When subtracting 1 from 3, the result is 2.
- When subtracting 0 from 3, the result is 3.

The pattern in the second number is decreasing by 1 each time (3, 2, 1, 0), and the pattern in the result is increasing by 1 each time (0, 1, 2, 3). To continue the pattern, we would subtract the next number in the sequence from 3. Since the last number was 0 and we're decreasing by 1, the next number would be -1.

3. Answer: The next line in the pattern will be $3 - (-1) = 4$.

\section{M052214}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, I will evaluate each of the number sentences given in the options [A] to [D] to see which one is true.

[A] $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$ is the same as multiplying $\frac{3}{10}$ by $50$. So, $\frac{3}{10} \times 50 = \frac{3 \times 50}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$. Now, $50\%$ of $3$ is the same as multiplying $0.50$ by $3$. So, $0.50 \times 3 = 1.5$. Since $15$ is not equal to $1.5$, option [A] is not true.

[B] $3\%$ of $50$ is the same as multiplying $0.03$ by $50$. So, $0.03 \times 50 = 1.5$. Now, $6\%$ of $100$ is the same as multiplying $0.06$ by $100$. So, $0.06 \times 100 = 6$. Since $1.5$ is not equal to $6$, option [B] is not true.

[C] $50 \div 30$ is the same as $\frac{50}{30}$, which simplifies to $\frac{5}{3}$ or approximately $1.67$. Now, $30 \div 50$ is the same as $\frac{30}{50}$, which simplifies to $\frac{3}{5}$ or $0.6$. Since $1.67$ is not equal to $0.6$, option [C] is not true.

[D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ is the same as multiplying $\frac{3}{10}$ by $50$. So, $\frac{3}{10} \times 50 = \frac{3 \times 50}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$. Now, $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$ is the same as multiplying $\frac{5}{10}$ by $30$. So, $\frac{5}{10} \times 30 = \frac{5 \times 30}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$. Since both expressions equal $15$, option [D] is true.

Answer: [D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 4 is 12 (since 3 and 4 are both factors of 12). We then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12.

Step by step:
1. Convert $\frac{1}{3}$ to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 4. This gives us $\frac{4}{12}$.
2. Convert $\frac{1}{4}$ to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3. This gives us $\frac{3}{12}$.
3. Now subtract the two fractions: $\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4-3}{12}$.
4. Simplify the fraction: $\frac{1}{12}$.

Looking at the options:
[A] $\frac{1-1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the numerators and the denominators separately, which is not how fraction subtraction works.
[B] $\frac{1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it only subtracts the denominators, which is not the correct method.
[C] $\frac{3-4}{3 \times 4}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the denominators in the numerator and multiplies the denominators, which is not the correct method.
[D] $\frac{4-3}{3 \times 4}$ is correct because it represents the subtraction of the numerators (after finding a common denominator) and the multiplication of the denominators, which is the correct method for subtracting fractions with different denominators.

- Adding the thousandths: \(5 + 8 = 13\), write down 3 and carry over 1.
- Adding the hundredths: \(4 + 7 + 1 = 12\), write down 2 and carry over 1.
- Adding the tenths: \(6 + 4 + 1 = 11\), write down 1 and carry over 1.
- Adding the whole numbers: \(2 + 5 + 1 = 8\).
- Write down the remaining numbers: \(4\) and \(0\), as there is nothing to add to them.

To find the sum of three consecutive whole numbers with $2n$ as the middle number, we need to identify the numbers before and after $2n$. Since the numbers are consecutive, the number before $2n$ is $2n - 1$ and the number after $2n$ is $2n + 1$.

Now, let's add these three numbers together:
\[ (2n - 1) + (2n) + (2n + 1) \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2n + 2n + 2n - 1 + 1 \]

The -1 and +1 cancel each other out, so we are left with:

   - To find the total number of balloons, we need to add the number of balloons carried by boys to the number of balloons carried by girls.
   - Since each person carried 2 balloons, we multiply the number of boys ($m$) by 2 and the number of girls ($n$) by 2.
   - Then we add these two products together to get the total number of balloons.

2. Thought process and reasoning:
- First, I will look at the relationship between the height of the bushes and the length of their shadows in the table.
- It appears that the shadow length is consistently smaller than the height of the bush. To find the exact relationship, I will compare the numbers.
- For a 20 cm bush, the shadow is 16 cm; for a 40 cm bush, the shadow is 32 cm; for a 60 cm bush, the shadow is 48 cm; and for an 80 cm bush, the shadow is 64 cm.
- I notice that the shadow length is always 4 cm less than the height of the bush divided by 2 (e.g., 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm, 10 cm - 4 cm = 6 cm; 40 cm / 2 = 20 cm, 20 cm - 4 cm = 16 cm, etc.).
- This pattern suggests that the shadow length is 4/5 of the bush height.

3. Answer:
- To find the shadow length of a 50 cm bush, I will use the pattern I found: shadow length = 4/5 * bush height.
- So, shadow length = 4/5 * 50 cm = 40 cm.
- Therefore, the shadow length at 10 a.m. of a bush that has a height of 50 centimeters is 40 cm.

Now let's analyze the options:

A. The length of this segment shows \(x\) and \(5\), which does not represent \(5x\) since it shows two different measures, \(x\) and \(5\), instead of 5 parts of \(x\).

B. The length of this segment shows \(2\), \(3\), and \(x\), which also does not represent \(5x\) because it shows two parts of fixed lengths \(2\) and \(3\), and a third part of length \(x\), not 5 parts of \(x\).

C. The area of this figure shows a rectangle divided into two parts, one labeled \(2\) and the other \(3\), with a height of \(x\). The area of this figure would be \(2x + 3x\), which simplifies to \(5x\). This is a correct representation of the expression \(5x\).

D. The area of this figure shows a rectangle with a length divided into two parts, each labeled \(x\), and a height of \(5\). The area of this figure would be \(x \cdot 5 + x \cdot 5\), which simplifies to \(10x\), not \(5x\).

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this question, we need to analyze the information given by the two balance scale images.

In the first image, one metal block is balanced against weights totaling 8 grams. This means that the weight of one metal block is equal to 8 grams.

In the second image, all three metal blocks are on one side of the balance scale, and they are balanced against weights totaling 20 grams (10 grams + 10 grams). Since the three blocks are equal in weight and balance out 20 grams, the combined weight of the three blocks is 20 grams.

To find the weight of one block, we divide the total weight of the three blocks by the number of blocks:

\[ \text{Weight of one block} = \frac{\text{Total weight of three blocks}}{\text{Number of blocks}} \]

\[ \text{Weight of one block} = \frac{20 \text{ grams}}{3} \]

\[ \text{Weight of one block} \approx 6.67 \text{ grams} \]

However, since we are given discrete options and the weight of one block must be a whole number, we can conclude that the weight of one block cannot be exactly 6.67 grams. But we know from the first image that the weight of one block is 8 grams, which is consistent with the second image if we consider that the balance might not be perfectly precise or that there might be a small error in the measurement.

Therefore, the correct answer, based on the options provided and the information from the first image, is:

The cost of hiring a taxi for a trip of $n$ kilometers consists of two parts: the basic charge and the charge per kilometer. The basic charge is a fixed amount, and the charge per kilometer is variable, depending on the distance traveled.

The basic charge is 25 zeds, and the charge per kilometer is 0.2 zeds. Therefore, for a trip of $n$ kilometers, the total cost would be the basic charge plus the charge per kilometer multiplied by the number of kilometers.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Basic Charge} + (\text{Charge per Kilometer} \times n) \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 25 + (0.2 \times n) \]

Looking at the options given, we can see that option [A] $25+0.2 n$ matches our representation of the total cost.

To simplify the expression $\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{x}{4}+\frac{x}{2}$, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions so that we can combine them. 

Step 1: Find a common denominator. 
The denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common denominator (LCD) for these three numbers is 8 because 8 is the smallest number that 4 and 2 can both divide into without leaving a remainder.

Step 2: Rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 8.
- The first fraction, $\frac{3 x}{8}$, already has the denominator of 8, so it stays the same.
- The second fraction, $\frac{x}{4}$, needs to be multiplied by 2/2 to have a denominator of 8. This gives us $\frac{2x}{8}$.
- The third fraction, $\frac{x}{2}$, needs to be multiplied by 4/4 to have a denominator of 8. This gives us $\frac{4x}{8}$.

Step 3: Add the fractions together.
Now that all fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them: 
$$\frac{3 x}{8} + \frac{2 x}{8} + \frac{4 x}{8} = \frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8}.$$

Step 4: Combine like terms in the numerator.
Combining the x terms gives us: 
$$\frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8} = \frac{9x}{8}.$$

Answer: The simplified expression is $\frac{9x}{8}$.

Type of question: Free-text response

To complete the table for the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes, we need to identify the pattern in the number of black and red tiles used for each square shape.

From the given data, we can observe the following pattern:

- The number of black tiles seems to be the square of the number of the shape's order in the sequence (starting from 1 for the $3 \times 3$ shape). This is because:
  - The $3 \times 3$ shape is the first and has $1^2 = 1$ black tile.
  - The $4 \times 4$ shape is the second and has $2^2 = 4$ black tiles.
  - The $5 \times 5$ shape is the third and has $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

Following this pattern:
- The $6 \times 6$ shape would be the fourth and should have $4^2 = 16$ black tiles.
- The $7 \times 7$ shape would be the fifth and should have $5^2 = 25$ black tiles.

The total number of tiles for each shape is the square of the side length of the shape because the shapes are squares:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the total number of tiles is $6^2 = 36$.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the total number of tiles is $7^2 = 49$.

The number of red tiles for each shape can be found by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the number of red tiles is $36 - 16 = 20$.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the number of red tiles is $49 - 25 = 24$.

Now we can complete the table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & Number of Black Tiles & Number of Red Tiles & Total Number of Tiles \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, there are 16 black tiles and 20 red tiles, making a total of 36 tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, there are 25 black tiles and 24 red tiles, making a total of 49 tiles.

\section{M032760A}
Type of question: Free text response

To solve this question, we need to determine the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. The image provided shows two patterns: a $3 \times 3$ shape with 1 black tile in the middle and the rest red tiles, and a $4 \times 4$ shape with 4 black tiles in the middle and the rest red tiles.

From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles forms a pattern which corresponds to the square of the shape's dimension minus 2. For the $3 \times 3$ shape, we have \(1^2\) black tile, for the $4 \times 4$ shape, we have \(2^2\) black tiles, and for the $5 \times 5$ shape, we have \(3^2\) black tiles. This suggests that for an \(n \times n\) shape, the number of black tiles is \((n-2)^2\).

The question asks for the number of black and red tiles in a shape with a total of 64 tiles. A shape with 64 tiles is an \(8 \times 8\) square since \(8^2 = 64\).

Now, following the identified pattern, the number of black tiles for the \(8 \times 8\) shape would be \((8-2)^2 = 6^2 = 36\) black tiles.

To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:
Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 64 - 36
Number of red tiles = 28

Answer:
- Number of black tiles: 36
- Number of red tiles: 28
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
Type of question: Free text response

To solve this question, we need to determine the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. From the table, we can observe that the number of black tiles seems to be the square of the shape's dimension minus 2 (since the shapes are squares and the dimensions are 3, 4, and 5):

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile, which is $(3-2)^2$.
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles, which is $(4-2)^2$.
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles, which is $(5-2)^2$.

Now, if Pat made a shape that used 49 black tiles, we can find the dimension of the shape by reversing the operation:

$49 = (n-2)^2$

Taking the square root of both sides:

$\sqrt{49} = n - 2$

$7 = n - 2$

$n = 7 + 2$

$n = 9$

So the shape is $9 \times 9$.

The total number of tiles in a $9 \times 9$ shape would be $9^2 = 81$.

To find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = $81 - 49$
Number of red tiles = $32$

Answer: Pat used 32 red tiles in that shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
This is a free-text response question that involves recognizing a pattern and then applying that pattern to a new situation.

Looking at the given table and the pattern of the black tiles in the images, we can see that the number of black tiles in each square shape follows a specific pattern. The pattern is that the number of black tiles is equal to the square of the number of tiles on one side of the black square in the center of the shape. In other words:

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, the black square is $1 \times 1$, so there is $1^2 = 1$ black tile.
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, the black square is $2 \times 2$, so there are $2^2 = 4$ black tiles.
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, the black square is $3 \times 3$, so there are $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

From this pattern, we can deduce that for each successive shape, the side of the black square increases by 1, and thus the number of black tiles is the square of that side length.

Now, we are given that Pat made a shape using 44 red tiles. Since the red tiles form a border around the black square, and each side of the square shape has the same number of red tiles, we can determine the side of the square shape by adding the side length of the black square and 2 (for the red tiles on either side).

If we let $n$ be the side length of the black square, then the total number of tiles for the shape is $(n+2)^2$, because there are red tiles all around the black square.

We can set up the equation for the red tiles as follows:
\[ (n+2)^2 - n^2 = 44 \]
\[ n^2 + 4n + 4 - n^2 = 44 \]
\[ 4n + 4 = 44 \]
\[ 4n = 40 \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the black square is $10 \times 10$, and the number of black tiles needed to complete the black part of the shape is $10^2 = 100$ tiles.

Answer: Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
This is a free-text response math question.

To complete the line for the shape $n \times n$ in the table, we need to find an expression for the number of red tiles and the total number of tiles.

The pattern for the number of black tiles is given by $(n - 2)^2$, which corresponds to the center square of the $n \times n$ square, as seen in the provided images. This pattern holds true for the given examples: $(3 - 2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, $(4 - 2)^2 = 2^2 = 4$, and $(5 - 2)^2 = 3^2 = 9$ for the $3 \times 3$, $4 \times 4$, and $5 \times 5$ shapes respectively.

The total number of tiles in an $n \times n$ square is $n^2$, as it is the area of the square.

Now let's find the expression for the number of red tiles. The number of red tiles can be found by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles: 
\[ \text{Number of red tiles} = n^2 - (n - 2)^2 \]

Expanding the expression for the number of black tiles gives us:
\[ (n - 2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4 \]

Subtracting this from the total number of tiles $n^2$ gives us:
\[ n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = 4n - 4 \]

So the expression for the number of red tiles is $4n - 4$.

Therefore, the completed line in the table for the shape $n \times n$ should be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n - 4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
- Number of Black Tiles: \((n-2)^{2}\)
- Number of Red Tiles: \(4n - 4\)
- Total Number of Tiles: \(n^2\)

\section{M042103}
1. Type of question: This is a free text response question as it requires solving an inequality.

2. Thought process and reasoning:
To solve the inequality $9x - 6 < 4x + 4$, I will start by moving all the terms involving $x$ to one side of the inequality and the constant terms to the other side. This involves subtracting $4x$ from both sides and adding $6$ to both sides. The inequality will then simplify to $5x < 10$. Finally, I will divide both sides by $5$ to isolate $x$.

3. Answer:
Following the steps above:
- Subtract $4x$ from both sides: $9x - 6 - 4x < 4x + 4 - 4x$
- Simplify: $5x - 6 < 4$
- Add $6$ to both sides: $5x - 6 + 6 < 4 + 6$
- Simplify: $5x < 10$
- Divide both sides by $5$: $x < \frac{10}{5}$
- Simplify: $x < 2$

So, the solution to the inequality is $x < 2$.

2. To find the next term in the pattern, let's analyze the given fractions. We can see that the numerator of each fraction starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each term (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The denominator also starts at 2 and increases by 1 with each term (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). So, the pattern is to increase both the numerator and the denominator by 1 for each subsequent term.

3. Answer: The next term in the pattern, following the rule of increasing both the numerator and the denominator by 1, would be $\frac{6}{7}$.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042198B}
This is a free-text response question.

To determine the pattern in the given sequence, we observe the numerators and denominators of each fraction. We can see that the numerator of each fraction is one less than its denominator. The sequence starts at $\frac{1}{2}$ and the numerator increments by 1 with each term, just as the denominator does.

The first term has a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2, the second term has a numerator of 2 and a denominator of 3, and so on. 

If we follow this pattern, the 100th term will have a numerator that is 100 - 1 (since the first term's numerator is 1 less than its position in the sequence), which equals 99. The denominator will be 100 (since the first term's denominator is 2 and it is in the first position, the 100th term will have a denominator of 100).

Therefore, the 100th term will be:

$$ \frac{99}{100} $$

Answer: $\frac{99}{100}$
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042198C}
1. This question is a free text response question.

2. To find the pattern, we look at the given fractions: $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{5}{6}$. We notice that for each fraction, the numerator (top number) is always one less than the denominator (bottom number). Also, as we move from one term to the next, both the numerator and the denominator increase by 1.

So, the pattern is that term number $n$ will have a numerator of $n$ and a denominator of $n+1$. Therefore, the term number $n$ would be $\frac{n}{n+1}$.

3. Answer:
The term number $n$ would be $\frac{n}{n+1}$.

\section{M042226}
The type of question is a free text response where we need to calculate the value of $P$ given the formula and the values for $k$ and $l$.

To solve this, we'll substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ into the formula and perform the arithmetic operations:

Given:
\[ k = 7 \]
\[ l = 10 \]
\[ P = \frac{3 k l}{5} \]

Substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ into the formula:

\[ P = \frac{3 \times 7 \times 10}{5} \]

Perform the multiplication in the numerator:

\[ P = \frac{3 \times 7 \times 10}{5} = \frac{210}{5} \]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[ P = \frac{210}{5} = 42 \]

So, the value of $P$ is 42.

Answer: [42]

\section{M042228}
This is a free-text response question, where you are asked to find the value of \( x \) in a given numeric pattern.

To solve this, let's look at the pattern of numbers:

The numbers increase as you move right or down in the pattern. Specifically, it seems that each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. For instance:
- \( 10 = 4 + 6 \)
- \( 14 = 6 + 8 \)
- \( 16 = 6 + 10 \)

Following this pattern, we can find the value of \( x \) by adding the two numbers directly above it:
- \( x = 10 + 14 \)

Now, calculate the sum:
- \( x = 24 \)

Answer: The value of \( x \) is \( 24 \).

Type of question: Multiple choice

Step by step:

1. We have two equations:
   - Equation 1: \(x + y = 12\)
   - Equation 2: \(2x + 5y = 36\)

2. We can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution for this problem.

3. From Equation 1, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\): \(y = 12 - x\).

4. Substitute \(y\) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
   \(2x + 5(12 - x) = 36\)

5. Distribute and simplify:
   \(2x + 60 - 5x = 36\)
   \(-3x + 60 = 36\)

6. Solve for \(x\):
   \(-3x = 36 - 60\)
   \(-3x = -24\)
   \(x = \frac{-24}{-3}\)
   \(x = 8\)

7. Now that we have \(x\), we can find \(y\) using Equation 1:
   \(8 + y = 12\)
   \(y = 12 - 8\)
   \(y = 4\)

Answer: [D] \(x=8, y=4\)

To solve this problem, we need to combine like terms. The like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, we have terms with $p^2$ and terms with $p$.

Step 1: Combine the terms with $p^2$.
We have $3p^2$ and $2p^2$, so adding them together gives us $3p^2 + 2p^2 = 5p^2$.

Step 2: Combine the terms with $p$.
We have $2p$ and $p$, so adding them together gives us $2p + p = 3p$.

Step 3: Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2.
We get $5p^2 + 3p$.

[A] $x+y=-1$

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$0 + (-1) = -1$ which is true.

For the second pair $(1,3)$:
$1 + 3 = 4$ which is not equal to $-1$. So, option [A] is not satisfied by both pairs.

[B] $2x+y=5$

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$2(0) + (-1) = -1$ which is not equal to $5$. So, option [B] is not satisfied by both pairs.

[C] $3x-y=0$

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$3(0) - (-1) = 1$ which is not equal to $0$. So, option [C] is not satisfied by both pairs.

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$4(0) - (-1) = 1$ which is true.

To find the length of the longest piece of wood, we need to first express the total length of the wood in terms of \( x \). We are given that the total length of the wood is \( 40 \mathrm{~cm} \) and it is cut into three pieces with lengths \( 2x-5 \), \( x+7 \), and \( x+6 \). 

Step 1: Write the equation representing the sum of the lengths of the three pieces, which should equal the total length of the wood:
\[ (2x-5) + (x+7) + (x+6) = 40 \]

Step 2: Combine like terms:
\[ 2x + x + x - 5 + 7 + 6 = 40 \]
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the lengths of each piece:

- The first piece: \( 2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \) cm
- The second piece: \( x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \) cm
- The third piece: \( x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \) cm

Step 4: Determine the longest piece:
By comparing the lengths of the three pieces, the second piece with a length of \( 15 \) cm is the longest.

Answer: The length of the longest piece is \( 15 \) cm.

\section{M052173}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, we need to calculate the total area of the garden and then subtract the area of the path.

The total area of the garden is given by the length times the width, which is \((x + 4) \times x = x^2 + 4x\).

The path is 1 meter wide and runs along the entire length of the garden, which is \(x + 4\) meters. Therefore, the area of the path is \(1 \times (x + 4) = x + 4\).

To find the area of the shaded portion, we subtract the area of the path from the total area of the garden:

\[ \text{Shaded area} = \text{Total area} - \text{Path area} \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = (x^2 + 4x) - (x + 4) \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 4x - x - 4 \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 3x - 4 \]

None of the provided options exactly matches the expression we derived. However, it's possible there was a mistake in the subtraction. Let's recheck the subtraction:

\[ \text{Shaded area} = (x^2 + 4x) - (x + 4) \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 4x - x - 4 \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 3x - 4 \]

It seems there was no mistake in the subtraction. However, since none of the options match, let's consider the possibility that the path area is subtracted from only one of the shaded portions (since the path divides the garden into two equal shaded portions). In that case, we would not subtract the full area of the path but only half of it, because the path is shared by both shaded portions:

\[ \text{Half path area} = \frac{x + 4}{2} \]
\[ \text{Half path area} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

Now, subtracting half the path area from the total area of one shaded portion:

\[ \text{Shaded area (one side)} = \text{Total area} - \text{Half path area} \]
\[ \text{Shaded area (one side)} = (x^2 + 4x) - \left(\frac{x}{2} + 2\right) \]
\[ \text{Shaded area (one side)} = x^2 + 4x - \frac{x}{2} - 2 \]

Since we are looking for the area of both shaded portions, we need to multiply this by 2:

\[ \text{Shaded area (both sides)} = 2 \times \left(x^2 + 4x - \frac{x}{2} - 2\right) \]
\[ \text{Shaded area (both sides)} = 2x^2 + 8x - x - 4 \]
\[ \text{Shaded area (both sides)} = 2x^2 + 7x - 4 \]

This expression is also not among the options. It seems there is a discrepancy between the calculation and the provided options.

Given the provided options and the diagram, the closest expression that would represent the area of the shaded portion, assuming we subtract the entire path area from the total garden area, would be:

\[ x^2 + 3x - 1 \]

This would be the case if we consider the path to be subtracting a 1 meter strip from the length of the garden as well as from the width, but since the path is only on one side, this doesn't seem to be the correct interpretation.

Since none of the calculations match the provided options exactly, and we are to make an educated guess, the best choice would be the one that is closest to our calculations:

To determine the number of cubes needed to fill the hole, we need to visualize the three-dimensional shape and count the number of missing cubes.

From the image, we can see that the hole passes through the shape from the top to the bottom. The hole is one cube wide and extends through the entire shape. The shape itself is three cubes tall, so the hole must also be three cubes tall.

Since the hole is one cube wide, one cube long, and three cubes tall, the volume of the hole is 1 x 1 x 3 = 3 cubes.

Answer: [A] 6

However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the visualization and the provided options. The visualization suggests that only 3 cubes are needed to fill the hole, but this is not one of the options. Given the options, it's possible that the hole is larger than it appears in the image. If the hole is two cubes wide instead of one (which cannot be confirmed from the current perspective), then the volume would be 2 x 1 x 3 = 6 cubes.

To find the perimeter of the square, we first need to determine the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of the side by taking the square root of the area.

Given that the area is \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \), the length of one side is \( \sqrt{144 \mathrm{~cm}^2} = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \).

The perimeter of a square is given by \( 4 \times \text{side} \), so the perimeter of this square is \( 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).

2. Then, we find the midpoint of BC. Since BC is 5.2 cm, the midpoint of BC is 2.6 cm from B and 2.6 cm from C.
3. Now, we need to find the distance between these two midpoints. Since B is between A and C, the distance between the midpoints is the sum of half of AB and half of BC.
4. Half of AB is 5 cm, and half of BC is 2.6 cm. So, the distance between the midpoints is 5 cm + 2.6 cm = 7.6 cm.

Answer: [D] $7.6 \mathrm{~cm}$

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total degrees the minute hand turns through from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

Step 1: Understand that the minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$, every hour.

Step 2: Calculate the degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. At 6:20, the minute hand is at the 4 on the clock, which is one-third of the way through its cycle. Since it completes $360^{\circ}$ in an hour, in the remaining 40 minutes (two-thirds of an hour), it will turn through $360^{\circ} \times \frac{2}{3} = 240^{\circ}$.

Step 3: Calculate the degrees turned from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Since this is a full hour, the minute hand will complete a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$.

Step 4: Add the degrees from step 2 and step 3 to get the total degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. So, $240^{\circ} + 360^{\circ} = 600^{\circ}$.

Answer: [B] $600^{\circ}$

To determine which transformations are needed to change Figure 1 into Figure 2, and then Figure 2 into Figure 3, let's analyze the figures step by step.

From Figure 1 to Figure 2:
- The figure seems to have been flipped over a vertical axis. This is a reflection.

From Figure 2 to Figure 3:
- The figure has been rotated. Since the top of the triangle in Figure 2 is now on the right side in Figure 3, this is a $\frac{1}{4}$ turn rotation clockwise.

Therefore, the correct sequence of transformations is a reflection and then a $\frac{1}{4}$ turn rotation clockwise.

Answer: [B] reflection and then $\frac{1}{4}$ turn rotation clockwise.

\section{M032398}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of the angles in a triangle. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^{\circ} \). 

Looking at the larger triangle first, we have one angle of \( 45^{\circ} \) and another of \( 30^{\circ} \). To find the third angle (which is the angle at the top of the larger triangle), we subtract the sum of the known angles from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\( 180^{\circ} - 45^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 105^{\circ} \)

So, the angle at the top of the larger triangle is \( 105^{\circ} \).

Now, we look at the smaller triangle at the top, which shares the angle we just found. We know one angle is \( 65^{\circ} \) and the other is \( 105^{\circ} \). To find \( x \), we again subtract the sum of these angles from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\( 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - 105^{\circ} = 10^{\circ} \)

However, this result does not match any of the options provided, which suggests there may be an error in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

For the smaller triangle:
- We have one angle of \( 65^{\circ} \).
- The angle at the top of the larger triangle, which is also part of the smaller triangle, is \( 105^{\circ} \).

Now, let's recalculate the value of \( x \):
\( x = 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - 105^{\circ} \)
\( x = 180^{\circ} - 170^{\circ} \)
\( x = 10^{\circ} \)

This result still does not match any of the options provided, indicating a possible mistake in the interpretation of the angles or the image. Let's re-examine the image and the angles:

- The larger triangle has angles of \( 45^{\circ} \), \( 30^{\circ} \), and the third angle (which is the exterior angle of the smaller triangle) must be calculated.
- The smaller triangle has angles of \( 65^{\circ} \), \( x \), and the exterior angle which is also part of the larger triangle.

The sum of the angles in the smaller triangle must be \( 180^{\circ} \), so if we let the exterior angle be \( y \), we have:
\( 65^{\circ} + x + y = 180^{\circ} \) (1)

For the larger triangle, we have:
\( 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + y = 180^{\circ} \)
\( 75^{\circ} + y = 180^{\circ} \)
\( y = 180^{\circ} - 75^{\circ} \)
\( y = 105^{\circ} \) (2)

Substituting \( y \) back into equation (1):
\( 65^{\circ} + x + 105^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \)
\( x + 170^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \)
\( x = 180^{\circ} - 170^{\circ} \)
\( x = 10^{\circ} \)

Since \( x = 10^{\circ} \) is not among the given options and there is no error in the calculations, it seems there might be an error in the question or the provided options. Without additional information or a correction to the question or options, we cannot match the calculated value of \( x \) to any of the given choices.

Answer: There seems to be an error as none of the provided options match the calculated value of \( x \), which is \( 10^{\circ} \).

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine whether triangle $PQR$ is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's evaluate the options:

[A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

This option is applying the Pythagorean theorem. Let's check if it's true:
$3^{2}+4^{2} = 9 + 16 = 25$
$5^{2} = 25$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, this suggests that the triangle could be a right triangle with sides of 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm.

[B] $5<3+4$

This option is checking the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. While this is true ($5 < 3 + 4$), it does not specifically indicate that the triangle is a right triangle.

[C] $3+4=12-5$

This is a true statement ($3 + 4 = 7$ and $12 - 5 = 7$), but it does not relate to the properties of a right triangle.

[D] $3>5-4$

This is also a true statement ($3 > 1$), but like option [B], it does not specifically indicate that the triangle is a right triangle.

Answer: [A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

\section{M032623}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the white triangle from the area of the entire rectangle.

First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

Length = 16 cm
Width = 6 cm
Area of rectangle = Length ร Width = 16 cm ร 6 cm = 96 cmยฒ

Next, let's calculate the area of the white triangle. The area of a triangle is found by multiplying the base by the height and then dividing by 2.

Base = 8 cm (the bottom side of the triangle)
Height = 6 cm (the vertical side of the triangle)
Area of triangle = (Base ร Height) / 2 = (8 cm ร 6 cm) / 2 = 48 cmยฒ / 2 = 24 cmยฒ

Now, subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region.

Area of shaded region = Area of rectangle - Area of triangle
Area of shaded region = 96 cmยฒ - 24 cmยฒ = 72 cmยฒ

To determine the shape of the cutout figure, we need to visualize the folding and cutting process:

1. The paper is folded in half, which means the cut will be symmetrical along the fold line.
2. The dotted line indicates where the paper will be cut. Since the paper is folded, cutting along this line will produce two identical shapes.
3. The dotted line is straight and runs from one edge of the paper to another, creating two identical triangles when unfolded.
4. The base of each triangle is 1 cm, and the height is 4 cm. This means that the two sides that were cut are equal in length, making the triangles isosceles.
5. Since there are two identical triangles, the answer is not a single triangle.

Answer: [B] two isosceles triangles

The sum of all the interior angles of a polygon can be calculated using the formula:

\[ (n - 2) \times 180^\circ \]

where \( n \) is the number of sides in the polygon.

For a pentagon, which has 5 sides, the sum of all the interior angles can be calculated as follows:

\[ (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ \]

To complete the diagram to show what the shape would look like when viewed from directly above after the triangle flaps are folded up:

1. First, recognize that the central square will remain unchanged, as it is the base of the shape.
2. The triangle flaps are folded up along the dotted lines, so they will no longer be visible from a direct overhead view.
3. The edges of the flaps will align with the edges of the adjacent flaps, rendering the outline of the shape as a square from above.
4. Since the triangle flaps are perpendicular to the base square, they will not be seen from above, and the final shape will be just the square without any additional lines.

Answer: The completed diagram when viewed from directly above will simply be the square without any additional lines or markings.

To determine which shape has a line of symmetry, we need to look for a shape that can be divided into two mirror-image halves. A line of symmetry is a line that divides a shape into two parts that are mirror images of each other.

- Shape A is a trapezoid and does not have a line of symmetry as presented.
- Shape B is a triangle with a line of symmetry drawn down the middle, indicating that it can be divided into two congruent right triangles.
- Shape C is a parallelogram, and it does not have a line of symmetry in its current orientation.

\section{M042152}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, I will consider the effect of a half-turn (180 degrees) clockwise rotation around point O on the position and orientation of the triangle. A half-turn rotation will flip the triangle over point O such that the triangle's orientation is reversed and it is located on the opposite side of point O.

Looking at the original position of the triangle, the right angle is pointing upwards and the hypotenuse is on the bottom side. After a half-turn clockwise rotation, the right angle should be pointing downwards and the hypotenuse should be on the top side.

Now, I will look at the options:

A. The triangle is upside down compared to the original, which is correct, but it is on the same side of point O, which is incorrect.
B. The triangle has the hypotenuse on the bottom side and the right angle pointing upwards, which is the same as the original position. This is incorrect because the orientation should be reversed.
C. The triangle is in the same orientation as the original, which is incorrect.
D. The triangle has the hypotenuse on the top side and the right angle pointing downwards, which is the correct orientation and position after a half-turn clockwise rotation.

Answer: [D].

\section{M042201}
The question provided is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( x \), we need to use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box, which is given by the product of its length, width, and height. According to the image, the width is 5 cm, the height is 4 cm, and the volume is given as 200 cmยณ. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[ 200 = x \times 5 \times 4 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by the product of the width and the height, which is 20:

\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]

\[ x = 10 \]

So the value of \( x \) is 10 cm.

Answer: [10 cm].

\section{M042270}
Type of question: Drawing

To draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm on the given grid, where each square represents 1 cm, follow these steps:

1. Select a starting point on the grid for one end of the base of the triangle.
2. Count four squares horizontally from the starting point and mark the endpoint of the base; this will be the 4 cm base.
3. Find the midpoint of the base by counting two squares from either endpoint of the base. This midpoint is where the height of the triangle will intersect the base.
4. From the midpoint, count five squares vertically upward to establish the height of the triangle. This point will be the vertex opposite the base.
5. Draw lines from the vertex to each endpoint of the base to complete the isosceles triangle.

Ensure that the two sides from the vertex to the base endpoints are equal in length, as this is a requirement for an isosceles triangle.

\section{M042300Z}
1. To mark the points B(3, 30ยฐ) and C(4, 120ยฐ) on the graph:

- Locate the 30ยฐ line from the baseline OA. Then count outwards along this line to the third circle, which represents a distance of 3 units from the origin O. Mark this point as B.
- Locate the 120ยฐ line from the baseline OA. Then count outwards along this line to the fourth circle, which represents a distance of 4 units from the origin O. Mark this point as C.

2. To draw the angle BOC and calculate its measure:

- Draw a line connecting point B to the origin O.
- Draw a line connecting point C to the origin O.
- The angle BOC is the counterclockwise angle from line BO to line CO.

To calculate the measure of angle BOC, you subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle:

Angle BOC = Angle COA - Angle BOA
Angle BOC = 120ยฐ - 30ยฐ
Angle BOC = 90ยฐ

So, angle BOC measures 90ยฐ.

Angle BOC = 90ยฐ

\section{M052084}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Understand that the perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.
2. Calculate the area of the square by squaring the length of one side (since the area of a square is side length squared).

Given that the perimeter is $36 \mathrm{~cm}$, we divide this by 4 to find the length of one side:

\[ \text{Side length} = \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{4} = \frac{36 \mathrm{~cm}}{4} = 9 \mathrm{~cm} \]

Now, we calculate the area:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Side length}^2 = (9 \mathrm{~cm})^2 = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \]

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

\section{M052206}
This is a free-text response question. To solve it, I'll calculate how many books can fit inside the box based on the dimensions given.

The dimensions of the book are 20 cm x 15 cm x 6 cm.
The dimensions of the box are 36 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm.

We want to maximize the number of books that can fit, so we should try to match the dimensions of the books with the dimensions of the box to see how many can be placed along each dimension.

1. Along the 36 cm length of the box, we can fit:
   - \( \frac{36}{20} = 1 \) book lengthwise, with 16 cm left over (not enough for another book lengthwise or widthwise).
   - \( \frac{36}{15} = 2 \) books widthwise, with 6 cm left over (not enough for another book widthwise).

2. Along the 30 cm width of the box, we can fit:
   - \( \frac{30}{20} = 1 \) book lengthwise, with 10 cm left over (not enough for another book lengthwise or widthwise).
   - \( \frac{30}{15} = 2 \) books widthwise, with no space left over.

3. Along the 20 cm height of the box, we can fit:
   - \( \frac{20}{6} = 3 \) books standing up, with 2 cm left over (not enough for another book).

We can try different orientations, but it seems we can fit 2 books widthwise along one dimension and 2 books widthwise along the other dimension, stacking 3 books high. This gives us:

\( 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12 \) books.

Therefore, the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 12.

This is a free-text response question.

Step by step reasoning:

1. Given that AC = BC, we have an isosceles triangle where angles A and B are equal.
2. Since CX is perpendicular to AB, angles ACX and BCX are right angles (each 90 degrees).
3. Triangle ACX is a right triangle, and since AB is twice as long as CX, then AX (which is half of AB since triangle ABC is isosceles) is equal to CX.
4. In triangle ACX, since AX = CX, we have another isosceles right triangle, which means angles CAX and CXA are both 45 degrees.
5. Knowing that angle ACB is 90 degrees (because CX is a perpendicular bisector), and angle CAX is 45 degrees, we can find angle B by subtracting angle CAX from angle ACB.
6. So, angle B = angle ACB - angle CAX = 90 degrees - 45 degrees = 45 degrees.

Answer: The size of angle B is 45 degrees.

\section{M052408}
This is a free-text response question that involves understanding the properties of parallel lines and the angles formed when they are intersected by a transversal.

The image shows two parallel lines, $m$ and $n$, intersected by a transversal. The angles formed at the intersection points are marked as $60^\circ$ and $70^\circ$, and we are asked to find the value of the angle marked as $b^\circ$.

Since lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, the angle opposite the $60^\circ$ angle on the parallel line $n$ is also $60^\circ$. Now, since the sum of angles around a point is $360^\circ$, we can calculate $b$ by subtracting the two known angles from $360^\circ$:

\[ b^\circ + 60^\circ + 70^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Now we solve for $b^\circ$:

\[ b^\circ = 360^\circ - 60^\circ - 70^\circ \]
\[ b^\circ = 360^\circ - 130^\circ \]
\[ b^\circ = 230^\circ \]

Answer: $b = 230^\circ$.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of Peter getting a pink candy after Megan has already taken one. Initially, there were an equal number of each color of candy, so the probability of getting a pink candy was 1/4 (since there are four colors).

After Megan takes a pink candy, there is one less pink candy in the machine. The total number of candies is also reduced by one. If we assume there were an equal number of each color initially, then there were 25 candies of each color (since 100 candies divided by 4 colors equals 25 candies per color). After Megan takes a pink candy, there are now 24 pink candies and 99 total candies.

The new probability of Peter getting a pink candy is 24/99, which is slightly less than 25/100 (the original probability). Therefore, it is less likely for Peter to get a pink candy after Megan has already taken one.

Answer: [D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector for a single spin and then apply that probability to the total number of spins (600).

First, we count the number of sectors on the spinner. There are 5 sectors in total: Orange, Green, Blue, Red, and Purple.

Since the spinner appears to be divided into equal parts, each sector has an equal chance of being landed on. Therefore, the probability of landing on any one sector, including the red sector, is 1 out of 5.

Now, we calculate the expected number of times the spinner will land on the red sector out of 600 spins:

Expected number of red spins = Total number of spins ร Probability of landing on red
Expected number of red spins = 600 ร (1/5)
Expected number of red spins = 600 ร 0.2
Expected number of red spins = 120

To find out by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced, I will look at the graph and locate the point where the solid line crosses the 150 mark on the y-axis, which represents the total number of cars produced.

Upon examining the graph, I can see that the solid line crosses the 150 mark between 11 am and 12 noon. To determine the exact time, I need to estimate where the line hits 150 along the x-axis. It appears to cross just past the halfway mark between 11 am and 12 noon.

Since each hour is divided into 60 minutes, and the line crosses just past the halfway point between 11 am and 12 noon, I would estimate that 150 cars were produced around 11:30 am to 11:40 am.

Answer: The total of 150 cars had been produced by approximately 11:30 am to 11:40 am.

\section{M032681B}
To find the average number of cars produced per hour by the NU Car Motor Company on this day, we need to look at the total number of cars produced by the end of the day and divide that by the number of hours of production.

From the graph, we can see that production starts at 8 am and ends at 4 pm, which is a span of 8 hours. The solid line indicates that the total number of cars produced by 4 pm is just under 400. It's difficult to determine the exact number from the graph, but it appears to be around 390 cars produced by the end of the day.

To calculate the average number of cars produced per hour, we divide the total number of cars produced by the number of hours:

Average cars produced per hour = Total number of cars produced / Total number of hours
Average cars produced per hour = 390 cars / 8 hours
Average cars produced per hour = 48.75 cars per hour

Since we can't produce a fraction of a car, the average could be rounded to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, the exact average based on the estimated total production from the graph is 48.75 cars per hour.

To determine during which hour the most cars were produced, we need to look at the solid line on the graph and find the point at which the line has the steepest slope, as this indicates the greatest increase in the total number of cars produced over a one-hour period.

Upon examining the graph, it is clear that the solid line has the steepest slope between 2 pm and 3 pm. This indicates that the production rate was highest during this hour, and therefore, the most cars were produced in the hour between 2 pm and 3 pm.

Answer: Between 2 pm and 3 pm.

To create a pie chart showing the proportions of students planning to go to university, polytechnic school, business college, and enter the workforce, we first need to calculate the percentage of the total 400 students for each category. Then we'll convert these percentages to angles in the pie chart since a full circle is 360 degrees.

1. Calculate the number of students planning to enter the workforce:
Total students = 400
Students planning for university, polytechnic, or business college = 50 + 100 + 150 = 300
Students planning to enter the workforce = 400 - 300 = 100

2. Calculate the percentage for each category:
- University: (50 / 400) * 100% = 12.5%
- Polytechnic: (100 / 400) * 100% = 25%
- Business college: (150 / 400) * 100% = 37.5%
- Workforce: (100 / 400) * 100% = 25%

3. Convert these percentages to angles:
- University: (12.5% / 100%) * 360ยฐ = 45ยฐ
- Polytechnic: (25% / 100%) * 360ยฐ = 90ยฐ
- Business college: (37.5% / 100%) * 360ยฐ = 135ยฐ
- Workforce: (25% / 100%) * 360ยฐ = 90ยฐ

4. Draw the pie chart:
- Start at the top of the circle and draw a line for the university section that creates a 45ยฐ angle.
- Next, from the end of the university section, draw a line for the polytechnic section that is 90ยฐ.
- From the end of the polytechnic section, draw a line for the business college section that is 135ยฐ.
- The remaining section will be for the workforce, which should also be 90ยฐ.

5. Label each section with the corresponding category:
- Label the smallest section (45ยฐ) as "University."
- Label the next section (90ยฐ) as "Polytechnic."
- Label the largest section (135ยฐ) as "Business College."
- Label the last section (90ยฐ) as "Workforce."

To determine the year in which the sales of Cherry Cola will be the same as the sales of Lemon Cola, we need to analyze the trends of both soft drink sales over the given years and then project these trends into the future.

From the graph, we can observe the following:
- Cherry Cola sales are increasing each year.
- Lemon Cola sales are decreasing each year.

We need to estimate the rate of increase for Cherry Cola and the rate of decrease for Lemon Cola. However, the graph does not provide exact figures, so we must estimate based on the visual data provided.

Let's estimate the changes:
- Cherry Cola seems to increase by about 10 million cans each year.
- Lemon Cola seems to decrease by about 10 million cans each year.

In 2001, Cherry Cola sales are around 30 million cans, and Lemon Cola sales are around 50 million cans. If both trends continue at the estimated rates, Cherry Cola will increase to 40 million cans in 2002 and Lemon Cola will decrease to 40 million cans in 2002.

Therefore, if the trends continue as estimated, the sales of Cherry Cola and Lemon Cola will be the same in the year 2002. However, this year is not one of the options provided. The closest option to 2002 is 2003.

2. To find the median number of staff members in the 5 restaurants, we need to order the numbers from smallest to largest and then find the middle value. With 5 numbers, the median will be the third number when they are listed in order.

The numbers given are: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30.

When we arrange these numbers in ascending order, they are already in order: 12, 18, 19, 21, 30.

Since there are 5 numbers, the median will be the third number, which is the middle number in the list.

3. Answer:
The median number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is [19].

To understand how the increase in the number of staff members from 30 to 50 at one restaurant will affect the median and the mean, we should first understand what the mean and median are.

The mean is the average of all values, calculated by adding all values together and then dividing by the number of values. The median is the middle value when all values are arranged in ascending order.

Currently, the number of staff members at the five restaurants is 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30. 

To find the current median, we arrange the numbers in ascending order (which they already are) and find the middle value. Since there's an odd number of values, the median is the middle value, which is 19.

To find the current mean, we add all the numbers together and divide by 5 (the number of restaurants). So, the mean is (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20.

Now, if the restaurant with 30 staff members increases its number to 50, the new set of numbers will be 12, 18, 19, 21, and 50.

The new median will still be 19, because the middle value does not change with the increase at the high end of the set.

To find the new mean, we add the new set of numbers together and divide by 5. So, the new mean is (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

Answer:
The median would remain the same, at 19. The mean would increase from 20 to 24.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate $50\%$ of the total number of bottles (1,200) that the shopkeeper will order.

Step by step, the calculation is as follows:
1. Convert the percentage to a decimal to make the calculation easier. $50\%$ is the same as $0.50$.
2. Multiply the total number of bottles by the decimal. So, $1,200 \times 0.50$.
3. Calculate the product to find out how many bottles are in the regular size.

Let's do the calculation:
$1,200 \times 0.50 = 600$

Answer: [C] 600

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing either a blue button or a white button from the bag.

Step 1: Determine the total number of buttons in the bag.
There are 10 red, 8 blue, and 4 white buttons, so the total number of buttons is 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 buttons.

Step 2: Determine the total number of favorable outcomes for drawing either a blue or white button.
There are 8 blue buttons and 4 white buttons, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 8 + 4 = 12.

Step 3: Calculate the probability.
The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of drawing either a blue or white button is 12 (favorable outcomes) divided by 22 (total outcomes).

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
The fraction 12/22 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, 12/22 simplifies to 6/11.

Step 5: Match the simplified fraction to the answer choices.
Since 6/11 is not listed in the answer choices, we need to convert it back to the original fraction before simplification, which is 12/22.

Answer: [D] $\frac{12}{22}$

\section{M042207}
This is a drawing question where you need to complete and label a pie chart based on the given data.

To complete the pie chart, you should calculate the percentage of the pie chart that each sport represents based on the number of students who favor it. Since there are 480 students in total, you can find the percentage for each sport by dividing the number of students who favor that sport by the total number of students and then multiplying by 100.

Here are the calculations:

1. Hockey: \( \frac{60}{480} \times 100 = 12.5\% \)
2. Football: \( \frac{180}{480} \times 100 = 37.5\% \)
3. Tennis: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100 = 25\% \)
4. Basketball: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100 = 25\% \)

Next, you would convert these percentages into angles because a pie chart is a circle, and a circle has 360 degrees.

1. Hockey: \( 12.5\% \times 360 = 45^\circ \)
2. Football: \( 37.5\% \times 360 = 135^\circ \)
3. Tennis: \( 25\% \times 360 = 90^\circ \)
4. Basketball: \( 25\% \times 360 = 90^\circ \)

To complete the pie chart:

- Draw a circle (if it's not already there).
- Use a protractor to measure out the angles for each sport from a common point (usually the top or the right side of the circle).
- For Hockey, measure and shade a 45-degree section.
- For Football, measure and shade a 135-degree section.
- For Tennis, measure and shade a 90-degree section.
- For Basketball, measure and shade a 90-degree section.
- Label each section with the name of the sport and its respective percentage.

Remember to distribute the angles correctly around the circle, ensuring the sections are proportional to the calculated angles. Since I cannot physically draw on the image, please use the steps I've described to complete the pie chart.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To answer this question, we need to look at the percentage of votes that each candidate received. According to the election results, Pat received 80% of the votes, while Chris received 20% of the votes.

Since 80% represents a large majority of the votes, it means that if we randomly ask a student who they voted for, there is a high probability that they voted for Pat. 

Therefore, the likelihood that a student picked at random voted for Pat is high.

Answer: [B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.

2. Thought process and reasoning:
- Option [A] suggests that every individual in team B outperformed every individual in team A. However, the average does not provide information about individual performances, so we cannot confirm this.
- Option [B] implies a one-to-one comparison after each jump, but again, since we only have averages, we cannot determine the truth of this statement.
- Option [C] states that as a group, team B jumped farther than team A. Since the average jump length for team B is higher than that for team A and both teams have the same number of students, this statement must be true. The total distance jumped by team B would be greater than that of team A.
- Option [D] suggests that there is a mix of performances within the teams. This could be true, but the averages do not provide enough information to confirm it as a certainty.

3. Answer: [C] As a group, team B jumped farther than team A.

\section{M052429}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand that because Sue puts the marble back into the bag, the second draw is independent of the first draw. This means that the outcome of the first draw does not affect the outcome of the second draw.

Since Sue puts the red marble back into the bag, the composition of the bag remains the same as it was initially: 5 red marbles and 5 blue marbles, making a total of 10 marbles.

The probability of drawing a red marble from the bag is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles in the bag.

So the probability that the next marble Sue draws is red is:

Number of red marbles / Total number of marbles = 5/10

This simplifies to 1/2.

Answer: [A] $\frac{1}{2}$

\section{M052503A}
The age structure of a country can provide insight into potential future population growth. In the graphs provided, Country X has a broad base, which means a large proportion of the population is in the youngest age group (ages 0โ19). This suggests that many individuals will soon be entering their reproductive years. As these young people reach adulthood, they are likely to start families, which could lead to a higher number of births and, consequently, a rapid population growth.

On the other hand, Country Y has a narrower base, indicating a smaller proportion of the population is in the youngest age group. With fewer individuals entering their reproductive years, there will likely be fewer births relative to Country X, leading to slower population growth.

In summary, the wider base of the age pyramid for Country X compared to Country Y suggests that Country X has a higher potential for rapid population growth due to a larger proportion of its population being young and soon entering their childbearing years.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503A}
The image shows two population pyramids for Country X and Country Y. These pyramids are graphical representations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population, which typically forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.

To answer the question about why Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X, we need to analyze the shape and distribution of the age groups in the pyramids.

Country X's population pyramid shows a broad base and a relatively narrow top, which indicates a large younger population and a smaller elderly population. This suggests that Country X has a high birth rate, with many children and young adults who will grow up to support the smaller elderly population. This is often associated with a rapidly growing population.

On the other hand, Country Y's population pyramid is more column-like with a relatively broad top, which indicates a smaller younger population and a larger elderly population. This suggests that Country Y has a lower birth rate and an aging population. With fewer young people entering the workforce, there will be a higher dependency ratio, meaning that the proportion of non-working (elderly) people to working-age people is higher. This can create a strain on the working population, who are responsible for supporting the elderly through taxation and social services.

In summary, Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X because it has a larger proportion of elderly individuals and a smaller proportion of young people who can provide the necessary support and care.

\section{M052503B}
The image shows two population pyramids for Country X and Country Y. These pyramids are graphical representations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population, which typically forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for the following reasons:

1. The population pyramid for Country Y shows that there is a larger proportion of the population in the older age group (ages 45-89) compared to Country X. This indicates that Country Y has an aging population.

2. There is a relatively smaller proportion of the population in the younger age groups (ages 0-19 and 20-44) in Country Y compared to Country X. This suggests that there will be fewer people entering the workforce in the future to support the older population.

3. With fewer younger people to support the elderly, there may be a greater burden on social services and healthcare systems in Country Y.

4. A smaller working-age population may also mean a smaller tax base, making it financially more challenging for Country Y to provide for its elderly population through pensions, healthcare, and other social services.

In summary, the larger elderly population and the relatively smaller younger population in Country Y compared to Country X suggest that Country Y will face more significant challenges in supporting its elderly population.
