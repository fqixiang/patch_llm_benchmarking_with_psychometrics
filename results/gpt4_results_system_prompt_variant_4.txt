To solve this problem, we need to calculate Jenny's share first, which is given as a fraction of the total amount. The fraction representing Jenny's share is $\frac{3}{8}$.

Step by step:
1. Calculate Jenny's share: Multiply the total amount of money ($560$ zeds) by Jenny's fraction ($\frac{3}{8}$).
2. Subtract Jenny's share from the total amount to find out how much Ann gets.

Calculations:
1. Jenny's share = $\frac{3}{8} \times 560$ zeds
2. Ann's share = Total amount - Jenny's share

Now, let's do the math:
1. Jenny's share = $\frac{3}{8} \times 560 = 3 \times 70 = 210$ zeds
2. Ann's share = $560 - 210 = 350$ zeds

Answer: [350 zeds]

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, we need to add the two fractions together. Since they have different denominators, we can't add them directly. We need to find a common denominator, which in this case would be 1000 since it's the largest denominator and the other denominator (100) is a factor of 1000.

First, convert $\frac{4}{100}$ to a fraction with a denominator of 1000. To do this, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10, which gives us $\frac{40}{1000}$.

Now we can add the two fractions:
$$\frac{40}{1000} + \frac{3}{1000} = \frac{43}{1000}$$

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
$$\frac{43}{1000} = 0.043$$

Answer: [A] 0.043

Type of question: Multiple choice

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.

Step 1: Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if 36 is divisible by 2.
- 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 is a prime factor of 36.

Step 2: Continue with the prime number 2 and see if the result, 18, is divisible by 2.
- 18 divided by 2 is 9, so another 2 is a prime factor of 36.

Step 3: Now we have 9, which is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.
- 9 divided by 3 is 3, so 3 is a prime factor of 36.

Step 4: We are left with 3, which is a prime number itself, so it is also a prime factor of 36.

Putting it all together, 36 can be expressed as the product of the prime factors 2, 2, 3, and 3, which is $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the location of \( N \) on the number line, we need to consider the multiplication of two fractions, \( P \) and \( Q \). Since both \( P \) and \( Q \) are located between 0 and 1, they are both less than 1. When you multiply two numbers that are each less than 1, the product will be smaller than either of the original numbers. Therefore, \( N \) must be located to the left of both \( P \) and \( Q \) on the number line.

Looking at the options provided:

A. Shows \( N \) to the right of 1, which is not possible since \( P \times Q \) would be less than 1.
B. Shows \( N \) between \( Q \) and 1, which is not possible for the same reason.
C. Shows \( N \) between \( P \) and \( Q \), which is not possible because the product of two numbers less than 1 cannot be greater than either of the numbers.
D. Shows \( N \) to the left of both \( P \) and \( Q \), which is consistent with the multiplication of two fractions less than 1.

We need to convert the mixed number $3 \frac{5}{6}$ into a decimal. 

Step by step, here's the thought process and reasoning:

1. Understand that the mixed number consists of a whole number and a fraction.
2. Convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. In this case, we divide 5 by 6.
3. Add the result of step 2 to the whole number part of the mixed number.
4. Round the final result to two decimal places if necessary.

Now, let's do the calculations:

1. The whole number is 3.
2. To convert $\frac{5}{6}$ to a decimal, we divide 5 by 6 which equals approximately 0.833333...
3. Adding this to the whole number part, we get $3 + 0.833333... = 3.833333...$
4. Rounding to two decimal places, we get 3.83.

Answer: [3.83]

\section{M042002}
To determine the greatest result when multiplying two two-digit numbers using the digits 3, 5, 7, and 9, we need to think about place value and how to maximize the value of each digit in the tens and ones places.

In general, to get the largest product, you want to have the larger digits in the tens place because they will contribute more to the overall value of the number than if they were in the ones place. Therefore, we want to use the largest digits, which are 9 and 7, in the tens places.

Now we need to decide which number should get the 9 and which should get the 7. Since we want to maximize the product, we should pair the largest tens digit with the largest ones digit that is available. After placing the 9 and 7, we will have the digits 3 and 5 left for the ones places.

Between 3 and 5, 5 is the larger digit, so we should pair it with 9 to maximize the product. That leaves the digit 3 to be paired with 7.

Thus, the largest two-digit number we can form with 9 and 5 is 95, and the largest we can form with 7 and 3 is 73. The multiplication would then be:

95
x 73
-----
This will give us the greatest product when the two numbers are multiplied.

Therefore, the digits should be placed as follows:

Top number: 9 in the tens place and 5 in the ones place.
Bottom number: 7 in the tens place and 3 in the ones place.

Answer: The top number should be 95 and the bottom number should be 73.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of exponents. When multiplying two powers with the same base, we add the exponents. 

From the table, we see that $256$ is equal to $4^{4}$ and $4,096$ is equal to $4^{6}$. 

So, $256 \times 4,096$ is the same as $4^{4} \times 4^{6}$. 

Using the property of exponents, we add the exponents: $4 + 6 = 10$.

Therefore, $256 \times 4,096$ expressed as a power of 4 is $4^{10}$.

Answer: [A] $4^{10}$.

To determine which number $K$ represents on the number line, let's first analyze the number line itself. We see that the segment between 27 and 28 is divided into equal parts. Counting these parts, there are ten of them, which means each part represents a tenth (0.1) of a unit.

The point $K$ is located two parts to the right of 27. Since each part is 0.1, two parts would be 0.2. Therefore, $K$ is 27 plus 0.2, which equals 27.2.

However, none of the given options is 27.2. It seems there might be a mistake in the options provided or in the interpretation of the number line. Based on the image and the standard interpretation of a number line, the correct answer should be 27.2, which is not listed. Given the options, the closest one to 27.2 is [A] 27.4, but it is still not the exact representation of point $K$ on the number line.

To find the value of $\square$, we need to find a number that makes the fraction $\frac{\square}{21}$ equivalent to $\frac{4}{14}$.

Step by step:
1. Simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ to its lowest terms. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, $\frac{4}{14}$ simplifies to $\frac{2}{7}$.
2. Now, we need to find a fraction with a denominator of 21 that is equivalent to $\frac{2}{7}$. To do this, we find a number that we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of $\frac{2}{7}$ by to get a new denominator of 21.
3. Since $7 \times 3 = 21$, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of $\frac{2}{7}$ by 3.
4. Multiplying the numerator 2 by 3 gives us $2 \times 3 = 6$.
5. So, the fraction equivalent to $\frac{4}{14}$ with a denominator of 21 is $\frac{6}{21}$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the full length of the pipe before the workman cut off a piece. We know that the piece he cut off, which is $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original pipe, is 3 meters long. 

To find the length of the original pipe, we can set up the following equation:

$\frac{1}{5} \times \text{original length of pipe} = 3 \text{ meters}$

To find the original length of the pipe, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

$\text{original length of pipe} = 3 \text{ meters} \times 5$

$\text{original length of pipe} = 15 \text{ meters}$

To find out the smallest number of boxes Kim needs to pack all the eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each box can hold.

1. Divide the total number of eggs (94) by the number of eggs per box (6).
2. Since 6 goes into 94 fifteen times with a remainder (since \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)), we know that 15 boxes will not be enough to hold all 94 eggs.
3. We need to account for the remaining eggs, which in this case is \( 94 - 90 = 4 \) eggs.

To solve this problem, I will evaluate each option step by step.

[A] $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50=50 \%$ of 3
To find $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$, you multiply $50$ by $\frac{3}{10}$, which gives $50 \times \frac{3}{10} = 5 \times 3 = 15$.
To find $50 \%$ of $3$, you multiply $3$ by $0.50$ (since $50\% = 0.50$), which gives $3 \times 0.50 = 1.5$.
Since $15 \neq 1.5$, option [A] is not true.

[B] $3 \%$ of $50=6 \%$ of $100$
To find $3 \%$ of $50$, you multiply $50$ by $0.03$ (since $3\% = 0.03$), which gives $50 \times 0.03 = 1.5$.
To find $6 \%$ of $100$, you multiply $100$ by $0.06$ (since $6\% = 0.06$), which gives $100 \times 0.06 = 6$.
Since $1.5 \neq 6$, option [B] is not true.

[C] $50 \div 30=30 \div 50$
To find $50 \div 30$, you divide $50$ by $30$, which gives $\frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3}$.
To find $30 \div 50$, you divide $30$ by $50$, which gives $\frac{30}{50} = \frac{3}{5}$.
Since $\frac{5}{3} \neq \frac{3}{5}$, option [C] is not true.

[D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$
To find $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$, you multiply $50$ by $\frac{3}{10}$, which gives $50 \times \frac{3}{10} = 5 \times 3 = 15$.
To find $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$, you multiply $30$ by $\frac{5}{10}$, which gives $30 \times \frac{5}{10} = 3 \times 5 = 15$.
Since $15 = 15$, option [D] is true.

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 4 is 12 (since 3 and 4 are both factors of 12). We then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12.

For $\frac{1}{3}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get $\frac{4}{12}$.
For $\frac{1}{4}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get $\frac{3}{12}$.

Now we can subtract the two fractions:
$\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4-3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$

Looking at the options:
[A] $\frac{1-1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the numerators and the denominators separately, which is not how fraction subtraction works.
[B] $\frac{1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it only subtracts the denominators.
[C] $\frac{3-4}{3 \times 4}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the denominators in the wrong order and multiplies the denominators, which is the correct approach but with the wrong subtraction order.
[D] $\frac{4-3}{3 \times 4}$ is correct because it subtracts the numerators correctly and multiplies the denominators, which is the correct method for finding a common denominator and subtracting fractions.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the height of the bush and the length of its shadow. Looking at the table, we can see that as the height of the bush doubles, the shadow length also doubles. This suggests a direct proportionality between the height of the bush and the length of the shadow.

From the table:
- A 20 cm bush has a 16 cm shadow.
- A 40 cm bush has a 32 cm shadow.

We can see that the ratio of the shadow length to the bush height is consistent:
\[ \frac{16}{20} = \frac{32}{40} = \frac{48}{60} = \frac{64}{80} = 0.8 \]

To find the shadow length of a 50 cm bush, we can use this ratio:
\[ \text{Shadow length} = \text{Bush height} \times 0.8 \]
\[ \text{Shadow length} = 50 \times 0.8 \]
\[ \text{Shadow length} = 40 \text{ cm} \]

To solve this question, we need to analyze the information given by the two balance scale images.

From the first image, we know that one block is heavier than 8 grams because the side with the block is lower than the side with the 8 grams.

From the second image, we see that three blocks are lighter than 20 grams because the side with the three blocks is higher than the side with the 20 grams.

Now let's analyze the options given:

[A] If one block weighs 5 grams, then three blocks would weigh 15 grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image. However, 5 grams is less than 8 grams, which contradicts the first image.

[B] If one block weighs 6 grams, then three blocks would weigh 18 grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image. Also, 6 grams is less than 8 grams, which contradicts the first image.

[C] If one block weighs 7 grams, then three blocks would weigh 21 grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image.

[D] If one block weighs 8 grams, then three blocks would weigh 24 grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image.

Given the analysis, none of the options provided seem to fit the conditions of both images. However, since we must choose one, we need to identify the option that at least satisfies one of the conditions. Option [A] satisfies the condition of the second image but not the first, and option [B] also satisfies the condition of the second image but not the first. Options [C] and [D] do not satisfy either condition.

Since the question asks for a possible weight of one block, and we know that the block must weigh more than 8 grams and three blocks must weigh less than 20 grams, we must choose the option that is greater than 8 grams but where three blocks weigh less than 20 grams. This leads us to an inconsistency because none of the options provided meet these criteria.

Given this inconsistency, it seems there might be an error in the question or the provided options. If we strictly follow the conditions set by the images, none of the options [A] to [D] are correct. However, if we must choose the best possible answer from the given options, we would choose the one that is closest to satisfying the second condition (three blocks weigh less than 20 grams) without violating the first condition (one block weighs more than 8 grams). This would be:

Answer: [B] $6 \mathrm{~g}$

This is an educated guess based on the given options and the conditions that must be met, even though it does not satisfy the first condition.

The cost of hiring a taxi for a trip of $n$ kilometers consists of two parts: the basic charge and the charge per kilometer. The basic charge is a fixed amount, and the charge per kilometer is a variable amount that depends on the distance traveled.

The basic charge is 25 zeds, which is a fixed amount that does not change with the distance.

The charge per kilometer is 0.2 zeds for each kilometer driven. So for $n$ kilometers, the charge would be $0.2 \times n$ zeds.

To find the total cost, we add the basic charge to the charge per kilometer, which gives us $25 + (0.2 \times n)$ zeds. This simplifies to $25 + 0.2n$ zeds.

To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. All the terms in the expression are 'x' terms, so they can be combined. However, they have different denominators, so we need to find a common denominator to combine them. The denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common denominator (LCD) for these is 8.

The first term is already over 8, so it remains $\frac{3x}{8}$.

The second term is $\frac{x}{4}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{2x}{8}$ (because $4 \times 2 = 8$).

The third term is $\frac{x}{2}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{4x}{8}$ (because $2 \times 4 = 8$).

Now that all terms have a common denominator, we can add them:

$\frac{3x}{8} + \frac{2x}{8} + \frac{4x}{8}$

Combine the numerators:

$\frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8}$

Add the x terms together:

$\frac{9x}{8}$

This is the simplified expression.

To complete the table for the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes, we need to determine the number of black tiles and red tiles for each shape. Based on the pattern from the given examples, it seems that the number of black tiles follows a perfect square sequence. Here's the reasoning:

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there's 1 black tile, which is $1^2$.
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles, which is $2^2$.
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles, which is $3^2$.

Following this pattern:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, we would expect $4^2$ black tiles, which is 16.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, we would expect $5^2$ black tiles, which is 25.

The total number of tiles in a shape is the square of the shape's dimension:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the total number of tiles is $6^2 = 36$.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the total number of tiles is $7^2 = 49$.

To find the number of red tiles for each shape, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape: $36 - 16 = 20$ red tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape: $49 - 25 = 24$ red tiles.

Now we can complete the table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape: 16 black tiles, 20 red tiles, 36 total tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape: 25 black tiles, 24 red tiles, 49 total tiles.

To solve this question, we need to determine the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. Based on the information given in the table and the images provided, we can see that the number of black tiles forms a square number sequence:

- $3 \times 3$ shape has 1 black tile, which is $1^2$.
- $4 \times 4$ shape has 4 black tiles, which is $2^2$.
- $5 \times 5$ shape has 9 black tiles, which is $3^2$.

This pattern indicates that for an $n \times n$ shape, there will be $(n-2)^2$ black tiles, since the first black tile appears in the $3 \times 3$ shape, which is equivalent to $1^2$.

Given that Pat made a shape with a total of 64 tiles, this would be an $8 \times 8$ shape because $8^2 = 64$.

Now we apply the pattern to find the number of black tiles:
Number of black tiles = $(8 - 2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.

Since the total number of tiles is 64, the number of red tiles would be the total tiles minus the number of black tiles:
Number of red tiles = Total tiles - Number of black tiles = 64 - 36 = 28.

Answer:
- Number of black tiles: 36
- Number of red tiles: 28

To solve this problem, we need to determine the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. Based on the information given in the table and the images provided, we can see that the number of black tiles forms a square number sequence:

- $3 \times 3$ shape has 1 black tile, which is $1^2$.
- $4 \times 4$ shape has 4 black tiles, which is $2^2$.
- $5 \times 5$ shape has 9 black tiles, which is $3^2$.

This pattern indicates that for an $n \times n$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$. Since Pat made a shape that used 49 black tiles, we can set up the equation $(n-2)^2 = 49$. Solving for $n$ gives us:

$n-2 = \sqrt{49}$
$n-2 = 7$
$n = 7 + 2$
$n = 9$

Thus, the shape is a $9 \times 9$ square. The total number of tiles in a $9 \times 9$ shape is $9^2 = 81$. Since there are 49 black tiles, to find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 81 - 49
Number of red tiles = 32

Answer: Pat used 32 red tiles in that shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
To solve this problem, we need to determine the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. From the table, we can observe that the number of black tiles seems to be the square of the side length minus 1. For example:

- In the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is $1$ black tile, and $3^2 - 1 = 8$ red tiles.
- In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are $4$ black tiles, and $4^2 - 4 = 12$ red tiles.
- In the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are $9$ black tiles, and $5^2 - 9 = 16$ red tiles.

From this pattern, we can infer that the number of black tiles is the square of an integer (n), and the number of red tiles is $n^2$ minus the number of black tiles.

Given that Pat made a shape using $44$ red tiles, we need to find the value of n where $n^2 - b = 44$, where b is the number of black tiles.

Since the number of black tiles is also a perfect square (as seen in the $3 \times 3$, $4 \times 4$, and $5 \times 5$ shapes), we can try to find a perfect square that is close to $44$ when subtracted from another perfect square.

The closest perfect square below $44$ is $36$, which is $6^2$. Let's check if the perfect square above $44$ minus $36$ is also a perfect square:

$49 - 36 = 13$ (not a perfect square)
$64 - 36 = 28$ (not a perfect square)
$81 - 36 = 45$ (not a perfect square)
$100 - 36 = 64$ (which is $8^2$ and a perfect square)

So, if we have $44$ red tiles, the side length of the square is $n = 8$ (because $8^2 = 64$), and the number of black tiles needed is $8^2 - 44 = 64 - 44 = 20$.

Answer: [20 black tiles].

\section{M032761}
The type of question is a free text response.

To complete the line for the shape $n \times n$ in the table, we need to find a general formula for the number of red tiles and the total number of tiles.

We are given that the number of black tiles for an $n \times n$ square is $(n-2)^2$. This is because the black tiles form a smaller square inside the larger square, and the side of this smaller square is two tiles less than the side of the larger square (one tile less on each side).

Now, to find the formula for the number of red tiles, we can observe the pattern in the given examples:

1. For a $3 \times 3$ square, the number of red tiles is 8. The total number of tiles is $3^2 = 9$.
2. For a $4 \times 4$ square, the number of red tiles is 12. The total number of tiles is $4^2 = 16$.
3. For a $5 \times 5$ square, the number of red tiles is 16. The total number of tiles is $5^2 = 25$.

The total number of tiles is $n^2$, which is the area of the $n \times n$ square. The number of red tiles is the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles.

So, the formula for the number of red tiles is:
Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n-2)^2$

Expanding the formula for the number of red tiles, we get:
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4)$
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4$
Number of red tiles = $4n - 4$

Thus, the completed line for the shape $n \times n$ in the table should be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n - 4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
Number of Red Tiles: $4n - 4$
Total Number of Tiles: $n^2$

To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply the length by the width. In this case, the length is given as \( x + 2 \) and the width is given as \( x \).

So, the area \( A \) of the rectangle is calculated as follows:

\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ A = (x + 2) \times x \]
\[ A = x \times x + 2 \times x \]
\[ A = x^2 + 2x \]

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \( x^2 + 2x \).

We are given the equation $a+b=25$ and are asked to find the value of $2a+2b+4$.

Step 1: We start by understanding the given equation, which states that the sum of $a$ and $b$ is 25.

Step 2: We then look at the expression we need to find the value of, which is $2a+2b+4$.

Step 3: We can factor out the 2 from the terms $2a$ and $2b$ to get $2(a+b)+4$.

Step 4: Since we know that $a+b=25$, we can substitute 25 in place of $a+b$ in the expression. So it becomes $2(25)+4$.

Step 5: Now, we multiply 2 by 25 to get 50 and then add 4 to get the final answer.

Answer: $2(25)+4 = 50+4 = 54$.

Thought process and reasoning:
We need to solve the inequality for x. To do this, we will isolate x on one side of the inequality.

Step 1: Subtract 4x from both sides to get the x terms on one side.
$9x - 6 - 4x < 4x + 4 - 4x$
This simplifies to:
$5x - 6 < 4$

Step 2: Add 6 to both sides to get the constant terms on the other side.
$5x - 6 + 6 < 4 + 6$
This simplifies to:
$5x < 10$

Step 3: Divide both sides by 5 to solve for x.
$5x/5 < 10/5$
This simplifies to:
$x < 2$

Type of question: Free text response

The pattern given is a sequence of fractions where the numerator is one less than the denominator for each term. The sequence starts with 1/2 and each subsequent fraction increases the numerator and the denominator by 1 each time:

- The first term is 1/2, with numerator 1 and denominator 2.
- The second term is 2/3, with numerator 2 and denominator 3.
- The third term is 3/4, with numerator 3 and denominator 4.
- The fourth term is 4/5, with numerator 4 and denominator 5.
- The fifth term is 5/6, with numerator 5 and denominator 6.

To find the next term in the pattern, we increase the numerator and the denominator of the last term by 1:

- The sixth term will have a numerator of 5 + 1 = 6 and a denominator of 6 + 1 = 7.

Answer: [6/7]

\section{M042198B}
This is a free text response question.

To find the pattern in the given sequence, we observe the numerators and denominators of each fraction. We can see that the numerator of each fraction is one less than its denominator. The sequence starts at $\frac{1}{2}$ and the numerator increments by 1 each time, as does the denominator. 

So, to find the 100th term, we follow the pattern. Since the first term is $\frac{1}{2}$, the 100th term would have a numerator of $1 + (100 - 1) = 100$ and a denominator of $2 + (100 - 1) = 101$. 

Therefore, the 100th term would be $\frac{100}{101}$.

Answer: $\frac{100}{101}$.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042198C}
This is a free text response question.

The pattern in the given sequence is that the numerator of each fraction is one less than the denominator, and both the numerator and denominator increase by 1 from one term to the next. 

To find the term number $n$, we can generalize the pattern. The numerator is always one less than the denominator. If the denominator is $n$, then the numerator is $n-1$. 

Therefore, the term number $n$ would be $\frac{n-1}{n}$.

Answer: [The term number $n$ is $\frac{n-1}{n}$].

The type of question is a free text response.

To solve for $P$, we need to substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ into the equation $P=\frac{3 k l}{5}$.

Given that $k=7$ and $l=10$, we substitute these values into the equation:

$P=\frac{3 \times 7 \times 10}{5}$

First, we multiply the numbers in the numerator:

$P=\frac{3 \times 7 \times 10}{5} = \frac{210}{5}$

Next, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

$P= \frac{210}{5} = 42$

So, the value of $P$ is 42.

Answer: [42]

\section{M042228}
This is a free-text response question, where you are asked to find the value of \( x \) in a given pattern.

To solve for \( x \), let's look at the pattern in the numbers provided in the image:

Starting from the top row, the sequence of numbers is 2, 4, 6, 8. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.

Looking at the first column, the sequence is 2, 6, 16, 40. This does not appear to be an arithmetic sequence, but we can look for a pattern in the differences between the numbers. The differences are 4 (6-2), 10 (16-6), and 24 (40-16). This sequence of differences is 4, 10, 24, and it seems like each number is 2, 4, and 6 multiplied by 2, respectively. This suggests a pattern where the difference between the numbers in the first column is the corresponding number in the top row multiplied by 2.

If we apply this pattern to find \( x \), we can look at the number directly above \( x \), which is 14. If we multiply 14 by 2, we get 28. Therefore, the difference between 16 and \( x \) should be 28.

Now, we can calculate \( x \) by adding 28 to 16:

\[ x = 16 + 28 = 44 \]

Answer: [44]

Step by step:

1. We have two equations:
   - Equation 1: \(x + y = 12\)
   - Equation 2: \(2x + 5y = 36\)

2. We can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution for this example.

3. From Equation 1, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\): \(y = 12 - x\).

4. Substitute \(y\) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
   \(2x + 5(12 - x) = 36\)

5. Distribute and simplify:
   \(2x + 60 - 5x = 36\)
   \(-3x + 60 = 36\)

6. Solve for \(x\):
   \(-3x = 36 - 60\)
   \(-3x = -24\)
   \(x = \frac{-24}{-3}\)
   \(x = 8\)

7. Now that we have \(x\), we can find \(y\) using Equation 1:
   \(8 + y = 12\)
   \(y = 12 - 8\)
   \(y = 4\)

To solve this problem, we need to combine like terms. The like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, we have terms with $p^2$ and terms with $p$.

Step 1: Combine the terms with $p^2$.
We have $3p^2$ and $2p^2$, so when we combine them we get $3p^2 + 2p^2 = 5p^2$.

Step 2: Combine the terms with $p$.
We have $2p$ and $p$, so when we combine them we get $2p + p = 3p$.

Step 3: Write the final expression.
Now we combine the results from step 1 and step 2 to get $5p^2 + 3p$.

To solve this question, we need to check which equation is satisfied by both pairs of numbers $(x, y)$. We will substitute the given pairs into each equation and see if both pairs make the equation true.

Let's check each option:

[A] $x+y=-1$

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$0 + (-1) = -1$ which is true.

For the second pair $(1,3)$:
$1 + 3 = 4$ which is not equal to $-1$. So, option [A] is not satisfied by both pairs.

[B] $2x+y=5$

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$2(0) + (-1) = -1$ which is not equal to $5$. So, option [B] is not satisfied by both pairs.

[C] $3x-y=0$

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$3(0) - (-1) = 1$ which is not equal to $0$. So, option [C] is not satisfied by both pairs.

[D] $4x-y=1$

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
$4(0) - (-1) = 1$ which is true.

For the second pair $(1,3)$:
$4(1) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$ which is also true.

Option [D] is satisfied by both pairs of numbers.

To find the length of the longest piece of wood, we need to express all the lengths in terms of x and then find the value of x. Since we know the total length of the wood before it was cut, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

Step 1: Write down the equation representing the sum of the lengths of the three pieces, which should equal the total length of the piece of wood before it was cut.

\(2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40\)

Step 2: Combine like terms.

\(4x + 8 = 40\)

Step 3: Subtract 8 from both sides.

\(4x = 32\)

Step 4: Divide both sides by 4 to solve for x.

\(x = 8\)

Step 5: Substitute the value of x back into the expressions for the lengths of the three pieces to find their actual lengths.

The lengths of the pieces are:
\(2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \mathrm{~cm}\)
\(x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \mathrm{~cm}\)
\(x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \mathrm{~cm}\)

Step 6: Determine the longest piece.

The longest piece is the one with the greatest length, which is \(x + 7 = 15 \mathrm{~cm}\).

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, we need to calculate the total area of the garden and then subtract the area of the path.

1. The total area of the garden is the area of the entire rectangle, which is given by the length times the width. The length is \( x \) meters and the width is \( (x + 4) \) meters. So, the total area is \( x \times (x + 4) = x^2 + 4x \) square meters.

2. The area of the path is the area of a smaller rectangle that is 1 meter wide and \( x \) meters long (since it spans the entire length of the garden). So, the area of the path is \( 1 \times x = x \) square meters.

3. To find the area of the shaded portion, we subtract the area of the path from the total area of the garden:
\[ \text{Shaded area} = \text{Total area} - \text{Path area} \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = (x^2 + 4x) - x \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 4x - x \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 3x \]

To determine the number of cubes needed to fill the hole, we need to consider the dimensions of the hole. From the image, we can see that the hole is one cube wide, and it appears to run through the entire depth of the shape. The depth of the shape can be determined by counting the visible cubes on the top layer of the shape.

Counting the cubes on the top layer, we see there are three cubes along the width of the shape where the hole is not present. This suggests that the hole is three cubes deep. Since the hole is also one cube wide, and it appears to be one cube tall (based on the visible cubes), the volume of the hole is 1 (width) x 3 (depth) x 1 (height) = 3 cubes.

However, we must consider that the hole extends through the entire shape, which means there is another layer of cubes beneath the visible top layer. If the shape is two layers tall, then the hole would also be two cubes tall, doubling the number of cubes needed to fill the hole.

Therefore, the total number of cubes needed to fill the hole would be 3 cubes (from the top layer) x 2 (for the two layers in height) = 6 cubes.

Answer: [A] 6

To find the perimeter of the square, we first need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of the side by taking the square root of the area.

Given that the area of the square is \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \), we find the length of one side as follows:
\[ \text{side} = \sqrt{144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}} = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \]

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side} \). So, we multiply the length of one side by 4 to get the perimeter:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \]

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the distance between the midpoints of AB and BC, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the midpoint of AB, which is halfway between A and B. Since AB is 10 cm, the midpoint of AB will be 5 cm from A and 5 cm from B.
2. Find the midpoint of BC, which is halfway between B and C. Since BC is 5.2 cm, the midpoint of BC will be 2.6 cm from B and 2.6 cm from C.
3. Now, we need to find the distance between these two midpoints. Since B is between A and C, the distance between the midpoints will be the distance from the midpoint of AB to B plus the distance from B to the midpoint of BC.
4. We add the two distances: 5 cm (from the midpoint of AB to B) + 2.6 cm (from B to the midpoint of BC) = 7.6 cm.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total angle turned by the minute hand from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

Step 1: Understand that the minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$, every hour.

Step 2: Calculate the number of full hours between 6:20 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. There is 1 full hour between 6:20 a.m. and 7:20 a.m. and another full hour from 7:20 a.m. to 8:20 a.m. However, since we only need to calculate until 8:00 a.m., we have 1 full hour and a part of the second hour.

Step 3: Calculate the angle turned by the minute hand during the full hour from 6:20 a.m. to 7:20 a.m. This is $360^{\circ}$.

Step 4: Calculate the angle turned by the minute hand from 7:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Since the minute hand completes a full circle in one hour, in 40 minutes (which is 2/3 of an hour), it would turn through 2/3 of $360^{\circ}$. This is $360^{\circ} \times \frac{2}{3} = 240^{\circ}$.

Step 5: Add the angles from step 3 and step 4 to find the total angle turned by the minute hand. This is $360^{\circ} + 240^{\circ} = 600^{\circ}$.

Answer: [B] $600^{\circ}$

To determine which transformations are needed to change Figure 1 into Figure 2, and then Figure 2 into Figure 3, let's analyze the figures step by step.

From Figure 1 to Figure 2:
- The figure appears to have been flipped over the vertical axis. This is a reflection.

From Figure 2 to Figure 3:
- The figure has been rotated. Since the right angle in Figure 2 is at the bottom left and in Figure 3 it is at the bottom right, this is a clockwise rotation. Specifically, it is a 90-degree (or \(\frac{1}{4}\) turn) rotation clockwise.

Therefore, the correct sequence of transformations is:
- A reflection (to get from Figure 1 to Figure 2)
- A \(\frac{1}{4}\) turn rotation clockwise (to get from Figure 2 to Figure 3)

Answer: [B] reflection and then \(\frac{1}{4}\) turn rotation clockwise.

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of the angles in a triangle. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^{\circ} \). 

Looking at the larger triangle first, we have one angle of \( 45^{\circ} \) and another of \( 30^{\circ} \). To find the third angle (which includes \( x \)), we subtract the sum of the known angles from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\[ 180^{\circ} - 45^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 105^{\circ} \]

This \( 105^{\circ} \) angle is the sum of \( x \) and \( 65^{\circ} \) (since they are adjacent angles that form a straight line). To find \( x \), we subtract \( 65^{\circ} \) from \( 105^{\circ} \):

\[ 105^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 40^{\circ} \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \( 40^{\circ} \).

Answer: [B] \( 40^{\circ} \)

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine which reason explains why triangle $PQR$ is a right-angled triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's evaluate the options:

[A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

This statement translates to \(9 + 16 = 25\), which is true since \(25 = 25\). This is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem, suggesting that the triangle could indeed be a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 cm, 4 cm, and a hypotenuse of 5 cm.

[B] $5<3+4$

This statement translates to \(5 < 7\), which is true, but this inequality simply shows that the triangle inequality holds, which is a condition for the existence of a triangle. It does not specifically indicate a right-angled triangle.

[C] $3+4=12-5$

This statement translates to \(7 = 7\), which is true, but like option [B], it does not provide evidence that the triangle is right-angled.

[D] $3>5-4$

This statement translates to \(3 > 1\), which is true, but again, it does not provide evidence that the triangle is right-angled.

The only option that directly relates to the triangle being right-angled, according to the Pythagorean theorem, is:

Answer: [A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the white triangle from the area of the entire rectangle.

First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

In this case, the length is 16 cm and the width is 6 cm, so:

\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 16 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Next, let's calculate the area of the white triangle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

The base of the triangle is 8 cm and the height is 6 cm, so:

\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Now, subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region:

\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of rectangle} - \text{Area of triangle} \]

\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 - 24 \, \text{cm}^2 = 72 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Answer: [D] 72

\section{M032679}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the shape of the cutout figure, we need to consider the folding and cutting process described:

1. The paper is folded in half, which means that any cut made on the folded paper will be symmetrical along the fold line.
2. The dotted line indicates where the paper is cut. Since the paper is folded, cutting along this line will produce a symmetrical shape when unfolded.
3. The dotted line is straight and runs from one edge of the paper to the other, creating two congruent triangles when unfolded.
4. The length of the cut is given as 4 cm, which is the same as the height of the paper, and the base of the cut is 1 cm wide. This means that the two triangles will not have equal sides, so they cannot be equilateral triangles.
5. Since the triangles are symmetrical and share a common base (the fold line), they are isosceles triangles.

Answer: [B] two isosceles triangles

\section{M032692}
The sum of all the interior angles of a polygon can be calculated using the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°

where n is the number of sides in the polygon.

For a pentagon, which has 5 sides:

Sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 3 × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 540°

Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of pentagon ABCDE is 540 degrees.

To complete the diagram to show what the shape would look like when viewed from directly above after the triangle flaps are folded up:

1. Start with the square in the center of the cardboard shape, which will remain in the same position when viewed from above.
2. Each triangle flap will be folded upward, so the base of each triangle will align with the sides of the square.
3. Because the triangles are being folded up, they will not be visible when viewed from directly above. The only visible part will be the top surface of the square.

Answer:
- Draw a square identical to the second image provided. There will be no visible triangles since they are folded up and are perpendicular to the top surface of the square, thus not visible in a top-down view.

\section{M042152}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, I will consider the effect of a half-turn (180 degrees) rotation clockwise around point O on the position and orientation of the triangle. A half-turn rotation will flip the triangle over point O such that the triangle will face the opposite direction and will be located on the opposite side of point O.

Looking at the original position of the triangle, it is pointing upwards and to the right, and it is located in the upper right quadrant relative to point O.

After a half-turn clockwise rotation, the triangle should be pointing downwards and to the left, and it should be located in the lower left quadrant relative to point O.

Now, I will check the options:

A. The triangle is pointing downwards but is in the upper left quadrant, which is not the result of a half-turn rotation from the original position.
B. The triangle is in the correct quadrant (lower left) but is pointing upwards and to the right, which is the same orientation as the original position, not flipped as it should be after a half-turn.
C. The triangle is pointing upwards, which is incorrect, and it is in the lower right quadrant, which is also incorrect.
D. The triangle is pointing downwards and to the left, and it is in the lower left quadrant, which is the correct result of a half-turn rotation from the original position.

To find the value of \( x \) for the given rectangular box, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

We are given the volume, the width, and the height of the box, so we can solve for the length (denoted by \( x \) in the image).

The volume is given as \( 200 \, \text{cm}^3 \), the width is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \), and the height is \( 4 \, \text{cm} \).

Using the formula:

\[ 200 = x \times 5 \times 4 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{200}{5 \times 4} \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \, \text{cm} \]

Answer: \( x = 10 \, \text{cm} \)

\section{M042270}
This is a drawing question.

To draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm on the given grid, where each side of the small squares represents 1 cm, follow these steps:

1. Choose a starting point on the grid for one end of the base of the isosceles triangle.
2. Count 4 squares to the right of the starting point to mark the other end of the base.
3. Draw a horizontal line segment connecting these two points to create the base of the triangle, which will be 4 cm long.
4. Find the midpoint of the base by counting 2 squares from either end of the base line segment. This midpoint will be where the height of the triangle intersects the base.
5. From the midpoint of the base, count 5 squares upwards to mark the apex of the triangle, which will be the point directly above the midpoint of the base and 5 cm above it.
6. Draw two line segments from the apex to each end of the base to complete the isosceles triangle.

The triangle should have two sides of equal length (the legs), which are longer than the base, and the height of the triangle should be a perpendicular line from the apex to the midpoint of the base.

\section{M042300Z}
Since I cannot physically mark on the image, I will describe the process for marking the points B and C on the graph:

1. To mark point B(3, 30°):
   - Find the 30° line on the graph. This is the line that starts at the origin O and extends through the 30° mark on the outer circle.
   - Move outwards from the origin O along the 30° line to the third circle, which represents a distance of 3 units from the origin.
   - Point B would be located where the 30° line intersects the third circle.

2. To mark point C(4, 120°):
   - Find the 120° line on the graph. This is the line that starts at the origin O and extends through the 120° mark on the outer circle.
   - Move outwards from the origin O along the 120° line to the fourth circle, which represents a distance of 4 units from the origin.
   - Point C would be located where the 120° line intersects the fourth circle.

Now, to draw the angle BOC and determine its measure:
- Connect point B to the origin O with a straight line.
- Connect point C to the origin O with a straight line.
- The angle formed between these two lines at the origin O is angle BOC.

To find the measure of angle BOC, you subtract the smaller angle measurement from the larger one because both angles are measured from the baseline OA in a counterclockwise direction:
- Angle BOC = 120° (angle COA) - 30° (angle BOA) = 90°.

So, the measure of angle BOC is 90°.

Angle BOC = 90°.

\section{M052084}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the square, we first need to determine the length of one side of the square. Since the perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides and a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.

Given that the perimeter is $36 \mathrm{~cm}$, we divide this by 4:

$36 \mathrm{~cm} \div 4 = 9 \mathrm{~cm}$

Now that we know each side of the square is $9 \mathrm{~cm}$ long, we can calculate the area of the square. The area of a square is found by squaring the length of one side:

Area = side length × side length
Area = $9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

This is a free-text response question requiring an understanding of volume and spatial reasoning.

To determine the largest number of books that will fit inside the box, we need to consider the dimensions of both the books and the box. We need to figure out how many books can fit along each dimension of the box.

The book dimensions are 20 cm x 15 cm x 6 cm, and the box dimensions are 36 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm.

First, let's see how many books can fit along the length of the box:
- The length of the box is 36 cm, and the length of the book can be either 20 cm or 15 cm. If we use the longer side of the book (20 cm), we can fit \( \frac{36}{20} = 1.8 \) books. Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we can only fit 1 book along the length of the box using its longer side. However, if we use the shorter side of the book (15 cm), we can fit \( \frac{36}{15} = 2.4 \) books. This still doesn't allow for a whole number of books, so we can only fit 2 books along the length of the box using its shorter side.

Next, let's see how many books can fit along the width of the box:
- The width of the box is 30 cm. If we've already used the shorter side of the book to fit along the length, we must use the longer side of the book to fit along the width. That means we can fit \( \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \) books. Again, we can't have half a book, so we can fit only 1 book along the width of the box using its longer side.

Lastly, let's see how many books can fit along the height of the box:
- The height of the box is 20 cm, and the height of the book is 6 cm. We can fit \( \frac{20}{6} = 3.33 \) books. We can't have a fraction of a book, so we can fit only 3 books along the height of the box.

Multiplying the number of books that fit along each dimension of the box gives us the total number of books that can fit inside the box:
- 2 books (length) x 1 book (width) x 3 books (height) = 6 books

Therefore, the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 6.

Answer: [6 books]

\section{M052362}
This is a free-text response question.

Step by step reasoning:

1. Given that AC = BC, we have an isosceles triangle where angles A and B are equal.
2. Since CX is perpendicular to AB, angles ACX and BCX are right angles (each 90 degrees).
3. Triangle ACX is a right triangle, and since AB is twice as long as CX, then triangle ACX is a 30-60-90 triangle.
4. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the angles are 1:√3:2. Therefore, angle ACX is 30 degrees and angle AXC is 60 degrees.
5. Since angle A is equal to angle B (isosceles triangle property), and angle A is 60 degrees (because it's the same as angle AXC), angle B must also be 60 degrees.

Answer: [60 degrees]

\section{M052408}
This is a free-text response question.

To determine the value of \( b \), we need to use the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal. In the diagram, lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel, and there is a transversal cutting through them, which creates alternate interior angles.

The angle marked as 60 degrees on the upper line \( m \) is an alternate interior angle with the angle marked as \( b \) degrees on the lower line \( n \). Since lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel, alternate interior angles are equal.

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is equal to the value of the alternate interior angle, which is 60 degrees.

Answer: [60 degrees].

To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of Peter getting a pink candy after Megan has already taken one. Initially, there were an equal number of each color of candy, so the probability of getting a pink candy was 1/4 (since there are four colors).

After Megan takes a pink candy, there is one less pink candy in the machine. Assuming there were 25 of each color initially (since 100 candies are divided equally among 4 colors), there are now 24 pink candies left. However, the total number of candies has also decreased by one, from 100 to 99. 

The new probability of Peter getting a pink candy is now 24/99, which is slightly less than the initial probability of 25/100 (or 1/4). Therefore, it is less likely for Peter to get a pink candy than it was for Megan.

Answer: [D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector for a single spin and then apply that probability to the total number of spins (600).

First, we count the number of sectors on the spinner. There are 5 sectors in total: Orange, Green, Blue, Red, and Purple.

Since the spinner appears to be divided into equal parts, each sector has an equal chance of being landed on. Therefore, the probability of landing on any one sector, including the red sector, is 1 out of 5.

Now, we calculate the expected number of times the spinner will land on the red sector out of 600 spins:

Expected number of red spins = Total number of spins × Probability of landing on red
Expected number of red spins = 600 × (1/5)
Expected number of red spins = 600 × 0.2
Expected number of red spins = 120

However, none of the provided options match the calculated expected number of 120. It seems there might be an error in the question or the provided options. Given the options, none of them is correct based on the calculation. Please check the question and options for accuracy.

Answer: None of the provided options [A] 30, [B] 40, [C] 50, [D] 60 is correct based on the calculation. The expected number should be 120.

To find out by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced, I will follow the steps below:

1. Locate the number 150 on the vertical axis labeled "Total Number of Cars Produced."
2. Move horizontally across from the 150 mark until I reach the solid line, which represents the actual car production.
3. From the point where the horizontal line from 150 intersects the solid line, move vertically down to the horizontal axis, which represents the time of day.

Following these steps, the horizontal line from the 150 mark on the vertical axis intersects the solid line slightly before the 12 noon mark on the horizontal axis. It appears to be around 11:50 am, but since the exact time isn't marked on the graph, we can only estimate based on the grid.

Answer: By approximately 11:50 am, a total of 150 cars had been produced.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
To find the average number of cars produced per hour by the NU Car Motor Company on this day, we need to look at the total number of cars produced by the end of the day and divide that by the number of hours of production.

From the graph, we can see that at 4 pm, the total number of cars produced (indicated by the solid line) is at the 400 mark. Since the production starts at 8 am and ends at 4 pm, the production lasted for 8 hours (from 8 am to 4 pm: 8 am, 9 am, 10 am, 11 am, 12 noon, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, and at 4 pm the count is taken, hence 8 hours in total).

Now, we calculate the average number of cars produced per hour:

Average number of cars produced per hour = Total number of cars produced / Total hours of production
Average number of cars produced per hour = 400 cars / 8 hours
Average number of cars produced per hour = 50 cars per hour

Answer: [50 cars per hour].

\section{M032681C}
The graph provided is a line graph showing car production over time. To determine during which hour the most cars were produced, we need to look for the time period where the solid line (representing actual car production) has the steepest incline, as this indicates the greatest increase in production over the shortest amount of time.

From the graph, we can see that the steepest part of the solid line occurs between 2 pm and 3 pm. During this time, the line rises from just under 300 cars produced to over 350 cars produced. This indicates that the most cars were produced during the hour between 2 pm and 3 pm.

Answer: Between 2 pm and 3 pm.

\section{M032695}
Type of question: Drawing

To create a pie chart showing the proportions of students planning to go to university, polytechnic school, business college, and enter the workforce, we first need to calculate the percentage of the total 400 students for each category.

1. University: 50 students
2. Polytechnic school: 100 students
3. Business college: 150 students
4. Workforce: 400 - (50 + 100 + 150) = 100 students

Now we calculate the angle for each sector of the pie chart. The formula for the angle is:

\[ \text{Angle} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of students}}{400}\right) \times 360^\circ \]

Using the formula, we get:

1. University: \( \frac{50}{400} \times 360^\circ = 45^\circ \)
2. Polytechnic school: \( \frac{100}{400} \times 360^\circ = 90^\circ \)
3. Business college: \( \frac{150}{400} \times 360^\circ = 135^\circ \)
4. Workforce: \( \frac{100}{400} \times 360^\circ = 90^\circ \)

Now, I'll describe the steps to complete the drawing, as I am not capable of creating images:

- Start from the top of the circle and draw a line towards the center to create the starting point for the first sector.
- Measure and mark a 45° angle from this line for the university sector.
- Draw a line from the 45° mark back to the edge of the circle.
- Measure and mark a 90° angle from the last line for the polytechnic school sector.
- Draw a line from the 90° mark back to the edge of the circle.
- Measure and mark a 135° angle from the last line for the business college sector.
- Draw a line from the 135° mark back to the edge of the circle.
- The remaining sector is for the workforce, which should also be 90° based on the remaining space.

Label each sector with the corresponding category: University, Polytechnic School, Business College, and Workforce. Make sure the labels are readable and placed either within the sectors or alongside them with a line pointing to the respective sector.

Remember to use a protractor to measure the angles accurately. If you don't have a protractor, you can estimate the angles based on known angles (e.g., 90° is a right angle, 45° is half of that, etc.).

\section{M032721}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the year in which the sales of Cherry Cola will be the same as the sales of Lemon Cola, we need to estimate the rate of change for each type of soft drink and then project when the two will intersect.

From the graph, we can observe the following:

- Cherry Cola sales are increasing each year. The increase from 1998 to 1999 is about 10 million cans, from 1999 to 2000 is also about 10 million cans, and from 2000 to 2001 is again about 10 million cans. This suggests a consistent annual increase of about 10 million cans.
- Lemon Cola sales are decreasing each year. The decrease from 1998 to 1999 is about 10 million cans, from 1999 to 2000 is about 5 million cans, and from 2000 to 2001 is about 5 million cans. This suggests an annual decrease that was initially 10 million cans but has slowed to about 5 million cans per year.

To predict when the sales will be the same, we need to find a year where the projected sales of Cherry Cola equal the projected sales of Lemon Cola. 

In 2001, Cherry Cola sold about 30 million cans, and Lemon Cola sold about 50 million cans. The difference is 20 million cans. If Cherry Cola continues to increase by 10 million cans per year and Lemon Cola continues to decrease by 5 million cans per year, the difference in sales will decrease by 15 million cans per year (10 million increase for Cherry Cola + 5 million decrease for Lemon Cola).

To find out how many years it will take for the sales to be equal, we divide the difference by the annual rate of convergence:

20 million cans / 15 million cans per year = 1.33 years

Since we cannot have a fraction of a year in this context, we round up to the next whole year, which means it will take approximately 2 years from 2001 for the sales to be equal. Adding 2 years to 2001 gives us 2003.

To find the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up the total number of staff members across all restaurants.
2. Divide the total number by the number of restaurants.

Step by step:

1. Adding the number of staff members: $12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30 = 100$ staff members in total.
2. Dividing the total number of staff by the number of restaurants: $100 \div 5 = 20$.

Type of question: Free text response

To find the median number of staff members, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order. The given numbers are already in ascending order: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30.

Since there is an odd number of data points (5 restaurants), the median will be the middle number. In a list of 5 numbers, the middle number is the 3rd one when arranged in ascending order.

Therefore, the median number of staff members is the number associated with the third restaurant, which is 19.

Answer: [19]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042169C}
Type of question: Free text response

To understand how the increase in the number of staff members from 30 to 50 at one restaurant will affect the median and the mean, we should consider the definitions of both measures of central tendency.

The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest. The mean is the average of the data set.

Currently, the number of staff members at the five restaurants, in ascending order, is: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30. 

1. Median calculation before the change:
The median is the middle number, so with five data points, the median is the third value, which is 19.

2. Mean calculation before the change:
To calculate the mean, we add up all the numbers and divide by the number of data points. 
Mean = (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20.

Now, let's consider the changes after the restaurant with 30 staff members increases to 50.

1. Median calculation after the change:
The new set of numbers is 12, 18, 19, 21, and 50. The median is still the third value when arranged in ascending order, so the median remains 19. The median is not affected by the increase because the increase does not change the middle position in an ordered list of five restaurants.

2. Mean calculation after the change:
To calculate the new mean, we again add up all the numbers and divide by the number of data points.
New Mean = (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

The mean has increased from 20 to 24.

Answer:
- The median remains the same (19).
- The mean increases from 20 to 24.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing either a blue button or a white button from the bag.

Step 1: Determine the total number of buttons in the bag.
There are 10 red, 8 blue, and 4 white buttons, so the total number of buttons is 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 buttons.

Step 2: Determine the total number of favorable outcomes (either blue or white buttons).
There are 8 blue buttons and 4 white buttons, so the total number of favorable outcomes is 8 + 4 = 12 buttons.

Step 3: Calculate the probability.
The probability of drawing either a blue or a white button is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of buttons. So, the probability is 12/22.

Step 4: Simplify the fraction (if necessary).
The fraction 12/22 can be simplified to 6/11, but since the options are not simplified, we will stick with 12/22.

Answer: [D] $\frac{12}{22}$

\section{M042207}
This is a drawing question where you need to complete and label a pie chart based on the given data.

To complete the pie chart, you should calculate the percentage of the total for each sport, then convert these percentages into angles for the pie chart since the total circle of a pie chart represents 100% or 360 degrees.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of students: 60 (Hockey) + 180 (Football) + 120 (Tennis) + 120 (Basketball) = 480 students.

2. Calculate the percentage of the total for each sport:
   - Hockey: (60 / 480) * 100% = 12.5%
   - Football: (180 / 480) * 100% = 37.5%
   - Tennis: (120 / 480) * 100% = 25%
   - Basketball: (120 / 480) * 100% = 25%

3. Convert these percentages into angles:
   - Hockey: 12.5% of 360 degrees = 0.125 * 360 = 45 degrees
   - Football: 37.5% of 360 degrees = 0.375 * 360 = 135 degrees
   - Tennis: 25% of 360 degrees = 0.25 * 360 = 90 degrees
   - Basketball: 25% of 360 degrees = 0.25 * 360 = 90 degrees

4. Use these angles to segment the pie chart accordingly.

5. Label each segment with the corresponding sport.

Since I cannot physically draw on the image, I can only describe the process. If you were to draw this, you'd segment the pie chart into four parts with the angles calculated above and label each segment with the name of the sport. The largest segment would be for Football, followed by equal segments for Tennis and Basketball, and the smallest segment for Hockey.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To answer this question, we need to consider the percentage of votes that each candidate received. Pat received 80% of the votes, which means that 80 out of every 100 students voted for Pat. Chris received 20% of the votes, which means that 20 out of every 100 students voted for Chris.

Since a higher percentage of students voted for Pat, it is more probable that a randomly selected student would have voted for Pat than for Chris.

Answer: [B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand what the average length of the jumps tells us about the performance of the teams. 

The average length of the jumps for Team A is 3.6 m, and for Team B, it's 4.8 m. Since there were the same number of students in each team, we can compare the averages directly.

Option [A] suggests that each student in team B jumped farther than any student in team A. However, the average does not give us information about individual jumps. It's possible that a student in Team A jumped farther than a student in Team B, but the overall average was lower for Team A. So, we cannot confirm that [A] MUST be true.

Option [B] implies that after every jump from Team A, a Team B member outperformed them. This could be true, but it's not necessarily the case. Team B could have had a few very long jumps that raised their average, while some of their jumps could have been shorter than the jumps from Team A. Therefore, we cannot confirm that [B] MUST be true.

Option [C] states that as a group, Team B jumped farther than Team A. This is supported by the average lengths given. Since the average of Team B is higher than that of Team A and both teams have the same number of students, it means that the total distance jumped by Team B is greater than that of Team A. So, [C] MUST be true.

Option [D] suggests that some students in Team A jumped farther than some students in Team B. While this could be true, the information given (the averages) does not guarantee it. It's possible that all students in Team B jumped farther than all students in Team A, or it could be the other way around. We cannot confirm that [D] MUST be true based on the information provided.

Answer: [C] As a group, team B jumped farther than team A.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand that because Sue puts the marble back into the bag, the second draw is independent of the first draw. This means that the outcome of the first draw does not affect the outcome of the second draw.

Since Sue puts the red marble back into the bag, the composition of the bag remains the same as it was initially: 5 red marbles and 5 blue marbles, making a total of 10 marbles.

The probability of drawing a red marble from the bag is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles in the bag.

So the probability P of drawing a red marble is:
\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of red marbles}}{\text{Total number of marbles}} \]

\[ P = \frac{5}{10} \]

\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \]

Answer: [A] $\frac{1}{2}$

\section{M052503A}
The age structure of Country X shows a much larger base of the population pyramid, which represents the youngest age group (ages 0-19). This indicates that there is a high proportion of young people who are likely to enter their reproductive years in the near future. As these individuals grow older and start families, the number of births is likely to increase, leading to rapid population growth.

In contrast, the age structure of Country Y shows a smaller base and a more uniform distribution of the population across different age groups. The proportion of younger individuals who will enter their reproductive years is smaller compared to Country X. This suggests that there will be fewer people having children in the near future, leading to slower population growth.

In summary, the broader base of the population pyramid for Country X indicates a higher potential for a growing population due to a larger number of individuals who will be entering their childbearing years.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503A}
The image shows two population pyramids for Country X and Country Y. These pyramids are graphical representations of the age and sex distribution of a country's population. They are divided into three age groups: Ages 0-19 (going to have children), Ages 20-44 (having children), and Ages 45-89 (finished having children).

From the population pyramid of Country Y, it can be observed that there is a larger proportion of the population in the oldest age group (45-89) compared to Country X. This indicates an aging population with a smaller base of younger people. Since the younger age groups are smaller, there will be relatively fewer people of working age to support the elderly both economically and through caregiving.

In contrast, Country X has a broad base of young people and a much smaller elderly population, indicative of rapid population growth. This suggests there will be a larger workforce in the future relative to the number of elderly, potentially making it easier for Country X to support its older population.

Therefore, Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X because it has a higher proportion of elderly to youth, which could strain resources and the workforce needed to provide for their care and support.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503B}
The image shows two population pyramids for Country X and Country Y. These pyramids are graphical representations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population which typically forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for several reasons:

1. The proportion of the population aged 45-89 (the elderly population) is larger in Country Y than in Country X. This is evident from the wider top section of the pyramid for Country Y.

2. The base of the pyramid for Country Y, representing the youngest age group (ages 0-19), is narrower than the base for Country X. This suggests that there are relatively fewer young people to support the older generation as they age.

3. The middle section of the pyramid for Country Y, representing the age group 20-44, is not significantly wider than the top section. This indicates that there will not be a sufficiently larger working-age population to support the elderly in the future as the current middle-aged population transitions into old age.

4. The structure of Country Y's population pyramid indicates slow growth, which typically means a lower birth rate. This can lead to a higher dependency ratio, where fewer workers are available to support a larger retired and aging population.

In summary, Country Y has a higher proportion of older individuals and a smaller proportion of younger individuals who will enter the workforce. This demographic structure suggests a heavier burden on the working-age population to provide for the needs of an aging population, potentially leading to economic and social challenges.
