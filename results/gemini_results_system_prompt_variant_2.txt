$\frac{3}{10}$ of $50 = 3 \times 5 = 15$
$50 \%$ of $3 = 0.5 \times 3 = 1.5$
15 is not equal to 1.5, so [A] is not true.
- [B] $3 \%$ of $50=6 \%$ of 100
$3 \%$ of $50 = 0.03 \times 50 = 1.5$
$6 \%$ of $100 = 0.06 \times 100 = 6$
1.5 is not equal to 6, so [B] is not true.
- [C] $50 \div 30=30 \div 50$
$50 \div 30 = \frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3}$
$30 \div 50 = \frac{30}{50} = \frac{3}{5}$
$\frac{5}{3}$ is not equal to $\frac{3}{5}$, so [C] is not true.

2. Let's think step-by-step. In the table, the number of black tiles is increasing by 1 for each shape. The number of red tiles is increasing by 4 for each shape. For the shape with a total of 64 tiles, let's assume that there are b black tiles and r red tiles. We have the equation:

$$b + r = 64$$

The number of black tiles is 1 more than the previous shape, which has 9 black tiles. So, the number of black tiles is 9 + 1 = 10.

$$10 + r = 64$$

The number of red tiles is 4 more than the previous shape, which has 16 red tiles. So, the number of red tiles is 16 + 4 = 20.

\section{M042300Z}
 1. Type of question: Drawing.

2. First, mark the point $B$. To do this, find the point on the graph that is 3 units away from the origin. Then, draw a line from the origin to this point. This line makes a 30-degree angle with the baseline. Therefore, the point $B$ is $\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)$.

Next, mark the point $C$. To do this, find the point on the graph that is 4 units away from the origin. Then, draw a line from the origin to this point. This line makes a 120-degree angle with the baseline. Therefore, the point $C$ is $\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)$.

3. To draw the angle $B O C$, first draw a ray from the origin through the point $B$. Then, draw a ray from the origin through the point $C$. The angle between these two rays is the angle $B O C$.

To measure the angle $B O C$, use a protractor to measure the angle between the two rays. The angle $B O C$ measures 90 degrees.

4. Answer: The angle $B O C$ measures 90 degrees.

2. The question is asking for the largest number of books that will fit inside the box. The volume of the box is 30 * 36 * 20 = 21600 cm^3. The volume of a book is 20 * 15 * 6 = 1800 cm^3. So the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 21600 / 1800 = 12.
3. 12
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052362}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. First, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $A X$. $A X^2 + X C^2 = A C^2$. Since $A C = B C$, and $A B$ is twice as long as $C X$, we have $A X^2 + X C^2 = (2 X C)^2$. Therefore, $A X = X C$.
 Now, we have a right triangle $X C B$ with $X C = A X$. The angle bisectors of a triangle are equal, so $\angle B = 2 \angle X C B$. But $\angle X C B = \angle A C B$, so $\angle B = 2 \angle A C B$. Finally, we know that $\angle A C B = 45^\circ$, so $\angle B = 90^\circ$.
3. [D]

\section{M032681A}
 1. The question is asking about the time when the total number of cars produced reaches 150. So it is a free-text response question.

2. The graph shows the total number of cars produced by the NU Car Motor Company during a particular day. The solid line shows the actual production, and the dotted line shows the total number of cars produced if the rate of production were constant.

To find the time when the total number of cars produced reaches 150, we need to find the point where the solid line intersects the dotted line. We can see that this point is at approximately 10:30 am.

3. The answer is 10:30 am.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
 1. The question is asking for the average number of cars produced per hour, so the answer should be a number. Therefore, the question type is free-text response.


2. The graph shows the total number of cars produced at different times during the day. The solid line shows the actual number of cars produced, and the dotted line shows the number of cars that would have been produced if the rate of production were constant. The average number of cars produced per hour can be found by dividing the total number of cars produced by the number of hours.


3. To find the total number of cars produced, we need to find the area between the solid line and the x-axis. We can do this by dividing the area into trapezoids and finding the area of each trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula (a + b)h/2, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides and h is the height.

a. The area of the first trapezoid is (0 + 100)8/2 = 400.
b. The area of the second trapezoid is (100 + 150)1/2 = 125.
c. The area of the third trapezoid is (150 + 200)2/2 = 350.
d. The area of the fourth trapezoid is (200 + 350)1/2 = 275.
e. The area of the fifth trapezoid is (350 + 400)1/2 = 375.

The total area is 400 + 125 + 350 + 275 + 375 = 1525.

To find the number of hours, we need to find the difference between the starting time and the ending time. The starting time is 8 am and the ending time is 4 pm, so the number of hours is 4 pm - 8 am = 8 hours.

The average number of cars produced per hour is 1525/8 = 190.625.

Answer: 190.625 cars per hour
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681C}
 1. Type of question: Multiple choice


2. First, let's think step-by-step. The question asks us to determine during which hour the most cars were produced. We can see that the solid line, which represents the actual number of cars produced, is highest at the 4 pm mark. However, the dotted line, which represents the number of cars that would have been produced if the rate of production were constant, is also highest at the 4 pm mark. This means that the rate of production was highest during the hour between 3 pm and 4 pm.


3. Answer: [D].

\section{M032695}
 1. The question is a drawing question. We need to draw a pie chart to show the proportions of students planning to go to university, polytechnic school, business college, and workforce.


2. First, we need to find the total number of students. The total number of students is 50 + 100 + 150 + 200 = 500.


3. Next, we need to find the proportion of students planning to go to university. The proportion of students planning to go to university is 50 / 500 = 1 / 10.


4. Similarly, the proportion of students planning to go to polytechnic school is 100 / 500 = 1 / 5, the proportion of students planning to go to business college is 150 / 500 = 3 / 10, and the proportion of students planning to enter workforce is 200 / 500 = 2 / 5.


5. Now, we can draw the pie chart. We can draw a circle and divide it into 10 equal sectors. We can then shade 1 sector to represent the proportion of students planning to go to university, 2 sectors to represent the proportion of students planning to go to polytechnic school, 3 sectors to represent the proportion of students planning to go to business college, and 4 sectors to represent the proportion of students planning to enter workforce.


6. Finally, we can label the pie chart. We can write "University" next to the sector representing the proportion of students planning to go to university, "Polytechnic School" next to the sector representing the proportion of students planning to go to polytechnic school, "Business College" next to the sector representing the proportion of students planning to go to business college, and "Workforce" next to the sector representing the proportion of students planning to enter workforce.


7. The final pie chart should look like this:

[Image of a pie chart with 10 sectors. 1 sector is shaded blue and labeled "University". 2 sectors are shaded green and labeled "Polytechnic School". 3 sectors are shaded red and labeled "Business College". 4 sectors are shaded yellow and labeled "Workforce".]

2. The graphs show the age structure of the population in Country X and Country Y. The age structure of Country X is younger than that of Country Y. This means that there are more people in Country X who are in the age groups that are most likely to have children. This is because the majority of Country X's population is between 20 and 45 years old, while the majority of Country Y's population is between 45 and 85 years old. Therefore, Country X will likely have more rapid population growth than Country Y.
3. The answer is [A].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503A}
 1. This is a free-text response question.
2. Country Y has a larger percentage of its population in the 0-19 age group than Country X. This means that in the future, Country Y will have a larger percentage of its population in the 20-44 age group, which is the age group where most people have children. This means that in the future, Country Y will have a larger number of people who are having children, which will lead to a larger population increase than in Country X. In addition, Country Y has a smaller percentage of its population in the 45-89 age group than Country X. This means that in the future, Country Y will have a smaller percentage of its population that is retired and will need to be taken care of by the working population. This will make it easier for Country Y to take care of its elderly population than it will be for Country X.
