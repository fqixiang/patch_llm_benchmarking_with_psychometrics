\section{M032352}
1. Type of question: Multiple choice.
2. Thought process: 
- The table shows a linear relationship between the bush height and the shadow length.
- To find the shadow length of a bush with a height of 50 centimeters, we can use the slope of the line formed by the data points in the table.
- The slope is the change in shadow length divided by the change in bush height.
- From the table, we can see that the change in shadow length is 16 centimeters when the bush height increases by 20 centimeters.
- Therefore, the slope is 16/20 = 0.8.
- To find the shadow length of a bush with a height of 50 centimeters, we can use the equation y = mx + b, where y is the shadow length, x is the bush height, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.
- We can find the y-intercept by substituting one of the data points from the table into the equation.
- For example, using the data point (20, 16), we get 16 = 0.8 * 20 + b, which gives us b = 0.
- Therefore, the equation of the line is y = 0.8x.
- To find the shadow length of a bush with a height of 50 centimeters, we can substitute x = 50 into the equation: y = 0.8 * 50 = 40 centimeters.

3. Now, we need to look at the four options and see which one represents the expression $5x$.
- Option A is the length of a segment. The length of the segment is $x+5$. This is not equal to $5x$, so we can eliminate this option.
- Option B is also the length of a segment. The length of the segment is $2+3+x$. This is not equal to $5x$, so we can eliminate this option.
- Option C is the area of a figure. The area of the figure is $2x \cdot 3 = 6x$. This is not equal to $5x$, so we can eliminate this option.
- Option D is the area of a figure. The area of the figure is $x \cdot (x+5) = x^2 + 5x$. This is equal to $5x$, so this is the correct answer.

Answer: D.

2. In the table, the number of black tiles increases by 2 for each shape, and the number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape. For the shape with a total of 64 tiles, the number of black tiles is (9 + 2) = 11, and the number of red tiles is (16 + 4) = 20.
3. [D] 11 black tiles and 20 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.


2. Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the relationship between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles is always one less than the number of red tiles. For example, for the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles, and for the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles.


3. So, if Pat used 49 black tiles, then he must have used 50 red tiles.


4. Answer: 50
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.

2. Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the relationship between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles in the shapes Pat made. From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles is always one less than the number of red tiles. For example, in the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles, and 8 is one more than 1. In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles, and 12 is one more than 4. So, the number of black tiles is always one less than the number of red tiles.

3. Now, we need to use this relationship to find out how many black tiles Pat would need to complete the shape using 44 red tiles. Since the number of black tiles is always one less than the number of red tiles, we can subtract 1 from 44 to find the number of black tiles Pat would need. So, 44 - 1 = 43.

4. Therefore, Pat would need 43 black tiles to complete the shape using 44 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. This is a free-text response question.

2. For the $n \times n$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$. This is because there is 1 black tile in the center, and $(n-2)^2$ black tiles on the border. The number of red tiles is $n^2 - (n-2)^2 = 4(n-1)$. This is because there are $n^2$ tiles in total, and $(n-2)^2$ of them are black.

3. The answer is $4(n-1)$.

\section{M032402}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.


2. To determine whether a triangle is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the sides of the triangle are 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. We can calculate the squares of the sides as follows:

3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
5^2 = 25

We can then check if the Pythagorean theorem holds:

9 + 16 = 25

Since the Pythagorean theorem holds, we can conclude that the triangle is a right-angled triangle.


3. The answer is [A].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032623}
 1. This is a multiple-choice question.
2. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. The base of the triangle is 8 cm, and the height is 6 cm. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 6 = 24 \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The area of the rectangle is given by the formula \(A = l\cdot w\), where \(l\) is the length and \(w\) is the width. The length of the rectangle is 16 cm, and the width is 6 cm. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \(A = 16 \cdot 6 = 96 \mathrm{cm}^{2}\). The area of the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle, or \(A = 96 - 24 = 72 \mathrm{cm}^{2}\).

-------------------------------------------
\section{M052362}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. We can think step by step as follows:
 - Let $AB=2x$, then $CX=x$.
 - Since $AC=BC$, we have $AC^2=BC^2$.
 - By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AC^2=AB^2+BC^2=4x^2+x^2=5x^2$.
 - Therefore, $AC=\sqrt{5x^2}=x\sqrt{5}$.
 - Since $AX=AC-CX$, we have $AX=x\sqrt{5}-x=\sqrt{5}x$.
 - By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $BX^2=AB^2-AX^2=4x^2-5x^2=x^2$.
 - Therefore, $BX=x$.
 - Since $BX=CX$, we have $\angle B=60^\circ$.

3. To find the time when the total number of cars produced reaches 150, we need to find the point where the solid line intersects the dotted line. We can see that this occurs at approximately 11:30 am.


4. Answer: 11:30 am.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. First, we need to find the total number of cars produced. We can do this by finding the area of the triangle and the rectangle.

The area of the triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 3 * 150 = 225 cars.

The area of the rectangle is base * height = 2 * 200 = 400 cars.

The total number of cars produced is 225 + 400 = 625 cars.

Next, we need to find the total number of hours. The graph shows the production from 8 am to 4 pm, which is 8 hours.

Finally, we can find the average number of cars produced per hour by dividing the total number of cars produced by the total number of hours.

625 cars / 8 hours = 78.125 cars per hour

\section{M052503A}
 1. The question is asking about the age structure of two countries and its impact on population growth. It is a free text response question.


2. The age structure of a population refers to the proportion of individuals in different age groups within the population. It is often represented graphically as a pyramid, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest age groups at the top.

The age structure of Country X is more likely to lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y because it has a larger proportion of individuals in the 0-19 age group. This means that there are more people who are likely to have children in the future, which will lead to an increase in the population. In addition, Country X has a smaller proportion of individuals in the 65+ age group, which means that there are fewer people who are likely to retire and stop working. This will lead to a larger workforce and more economic growth, which will in turn lead to more rapid population growth.


3. Answer: The age structure of Country X is more likely to lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y because it has a larger proportion of individuals in the 0-19 age group and a smaller proportion of individuals in the 65+ age group.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503A}
 1. The question is asking about the age structure of two countries and their population growth. It is a free-text response question.


2. The graphs show that Country X has a younger population than Country Y. This means that Country X has a higher percentage of people in the 0-19 age group and a lower percentage of people in the 65+ age group. This is because Country X has been experiencing rapid population growth, while Country Y has been experiencing slow population growth.


3. Country Y will have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population because it has a higher percentage of people in the 65+ age group. This means that there will be fewer people in the 20-64 age group to support the elderly population. In addition, Country Y has a smaller population overall, so there will be fewer people to contribute to the care of the elderly.

Answer: Country Y.
