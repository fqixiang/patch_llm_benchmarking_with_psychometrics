To find out how many zeds Ann will get, we first need to calculate how many zeds Jenny will get, and then subtract that amount from the total amount of $560$ zeds.

Jenny gets $\frac{3}{8}$ of the total money. To find out how much this is, we multiply the total amount of money by $\frac{3}{8}$:

Jenny's share = Total amount of money * Fraction of Jenny's share
Jenny's share = $560 * \frac{3}{8}$

To perform this multiplication, we can multiply the numerator (3) by the total amount (560) and then divide the result by the denominator (8):

Jenny's share = $\frac{3 * 560}{8}$

First, multiply 3 by 560:

Jenny's share = $\frac{1680}{8}$

Now, divide 1680 by 8:

Jenny's share = $210$

Jenny gets $210$ zeds.

Now we subtract Jenny's share from the total amount to find out how many zeds Ann will get:

Ann's share = Total amount of money - Jenny's share
Ann's share = $560 - $210

Now, subtract 210 from 560:

Ann's share = $350$

Therefore, Ann will get $350$ zeds.

To solve this, we need to add the two fractions together. 

First, let's convert the fractions to decimals to make it easier to understand. 

The fraction $\frac{4}{100}$ is equivalent to 0.04 because when you divide 4 by 100, you move the decimal point two places to the left.

Similarly, the fraction $\frac{3}{1000}$ is equivalent to 0.003 because when you divide 3 by 1000, you move the decimal point three places to the left.

Now, we can add these two decimals together:

0.04 + 0.003 = 0.043

So the answer is [A] 0.043.

\section{M032166}
To estimate the value of $\frac{7.21 \times 3.86}{10.09}$, we can round each number to the nearest whole number to make the calculation easier.

$7.21$ is closest to $7$,
$3.86$ is closest to $4$, and
$10.09$ is closest to $10$.

Using these rounded numbers, we can rewrite the expression as $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$.

Now let's check the options given to see which one matches our estimate:

[A] $\frac{7 \times 3}{10}$ - This underestimates the numerator since we rounded $3.86$ up to $4$.

[B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$ - This matches our estimate.

[C] $\frac{7 \times 3}{11}$ - This underestimates both the numerator and overestimates the denominator.

[D] $\frac{7 \times 4}{11}$ - This underestimates the denominator.

The best estimate is therefore [B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$.

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.

Let's evaluate each option:

[A] $6 \times 6$ - This is not a product of prime factors because 6 is not a prime number (it can be divided by 2 and 3).

[B] $4 \times 9$ - This is also not a product of prime factors because both 4 and 9 are not prime numbers (4 can be divided by 2, and 9 can be divided by 3).

[C] $4 \times 3 \times 3$ - This is not a product of prime factors because 4 is not a prime number (it can be divided by 2).

[D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$ - This is a product of prime factors because 2 and 3 are both prime numbers.

To confirm that [D] is the correct answer, we can multiply the prime factors together:

$2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 4 \times 9 = 36$

Thus, 36 can indeed be expressed as a product of prime factors as $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$, which makes [D] the correct answer.

\section{M032662}
To find the location of \( N \) on the number line, which is the product of \( P \) and \( Q \), we need to consider the relative positions of \( P \) and \( Q \) on the first number line.

Both \( P \) and \( Q \) are located between 0 and 1, which means they are both fractions less than 1. When you multiply two fractions that are each less than 1, the product will be smaller than either of the original fractions. Therefore, \( N \) must be located to the left of both \( P \) and \( Q \) on the number line.

Looking at the second image with the options A, B, C, and D:

- Option A places \( N \) to the right of 1, which cannot be correct because the product of two fractions less than 1 cannot be greater than 1.
- Option B places \( N \) between \( Q \) and 1, which is also incorrect for the same reason.
- Option C places \( N \) between \( P \) and \( Q \), which is incorrect because the product should be less than both \( P \) and \( Q \).
- Option D places \( N \) to the left of \( P \), which is the correct position since the product of two numbers less than 1 will be less than either of the numbers.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option D.

\section{M032725}
To convert the mixed number $3 \frac{5}{6}$ to decimal form, we first need to convert the fractional part $\frac{5}{6}$ to a decimal, and then add that decimal to the whole number part, which is 3.

To convert $\frac{5}{6}$ to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
$$\frac{5}{6} = 5 \div 6 \approx 0.833333...$$

The repeating decimal 0.833333... can be rounded to two decimal places as 0.83.

Now, we add the whole number part to the decimal part:
$$3 + 0.83 = 3.83$$

So, the mixed number $3 \frac{5}{6}$ in decimal form, rounded to two decimal places, is 3.83.

To express the value of $256 \times 4,096$ as a power of 4, we can use the table to find the powers of 4 that correspond to these numbers.

From the table, we see that:
- $256$ corresponds to $4^{4}$.
- $4,096$ corresponds to $4^{6}$.

When multiplying powers with the same base, we can add the exponents. Therefore, to find the product of $256 \times 4,096$ in terms of a power of 4, we add the exponents 4 and 6:

$4^{4} \times 4^{6} = 4^{4+6} = 4^{10}$.

So the value of $256 \times 4,096$ expressed as a power of 4 is $4^{10}$.

The correct answer is [A] $4^{10}$.

To determine the value that $K$ represents on the number line, we should first identify the scale of the number line. The main integers shown are 26 and 28, and there are ten smaller divisions between any two consecutive integers, which suggests that each division represents a tenth (0.1).

The point marked $K$ is eight divisions to the right of 27. Since each division represents 0.1, we can calculate the value of $K$ by adding 0.8 to 27:

\[ 27 + 0.8 = 27.8 \]

Therefore, $K$ represents 27.8 on the number line.

The correct answer is:

[B] 27.8

\section{M042031}
To find the value of $\square$ that makes the fractions equivalent, we need to find a common factor or a way to scale the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ so that the denominator becomes 21.

First, let's simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us $\frac{2}{7}$.

Now, we need to find a number that we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator of $\frac{2}{7}$ by to get a new fraction with a denominator of 21. Since $7 \times 3 = 21$, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator of $\frac{2}{7}$ by 3.

This gives us $\frac{2 \times 3}{7 \times 3} = \frac{6}{21}$.

Therefore, the value of $\square$ that makes the fractions equivalent is 6.

The correct answer is [A] 6.

To find the length of the original pipe, we need to determine what fraction of the original pipe 3 meters represents. We are told that the workman cut off $\frac{1}{5}$ of the pipe, and this piece is 3 meters long. 

This means that 3 meters is $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original pipe's length. To find the full length of the pipe, we need to multiply 3 meters by 5, because if $\frac{1}{5}$ of the length is 3 meters, then the whole length (which is 5 times $\frac{1}{5}$) would be 5 times 3 meters.

So, the length of the original pipe is $3 \times 5 = 15$ meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[C] $15 \mathrm{~m}$.

\section{M042059}
To find the missing value for James, we need to calculate the percentage of successful shots he made. He made 15 successful shots out of 20 attempts. To find the percentage, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of Successful Shots}}{\text{Total Attempts}}\right) \times 100
\]

Plugging in the numbers for James:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{15}{20}\right) \times 100 = 0.75 \times 100 = 75\%
\]

So, James had a success rate of 75%.

For Andrew, we know the percentage of successful shots, which is 80%, and we need to find out how many shots he made successfully. We can use the inverse of the previous formula:

\[
\text{Number of Successful Shots} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Total Attempts}
\]

Plugging in the numbers for Andrew:

\[
\text{Number of Successful Shots} = \left(\frac{80}{100}\right) \times 20 = 0.8 \times 20 = 16
\]

So, Andrew made 16 successful shots out of 20.

Filling in the missing boxes:

James: 75%
Andrew: 16 out of 20

\section{M042186}
The pattern given is a sequence of simple arithmetic operations, specifically subtraction, where the first number is always 3 and the second number is decreasing by 1 in each successive line.

Let's analyze the pattern:

1. $3-3=0$ (The second number is 3)
2. $3-2=1$ (The second number is 2)
3. $3-1=2$ (The second number is 1)
4. $3-0=3$ (The second number is 0)

From the given lines, we can see that the second number in the subtraction is decreasing by 1 each time (3, 2, 1, 0), and the result of the subtraction is increasing by 1 each time (0, 1, 2, 3).

To find the next line in the pattern, we need to decrease the second number by 1 again. Since the last second number was 0, decreasing it by 1 would give us -1.

Thus, the next line in the pattern would be:
$3 - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4$

So the answer is:
$3-(-1)=4$

\section{M052061}
To find out the smallest number of boxes Kim needs to pack all the eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs that each box can hold.

So, we'll divide 94 (the total number of eggs) by 6 (the number of eggs per box):

\[ \frac{94}{6} \]

When we perform this division, we get:

\[ 94 \div 6 = 15 \text{ R } 4 \]

This means that Kim can fill 15 boxes completely with 6 eggs each, and she will have 4 eggs left over. Since she cannot fit these 4 eggs into a box that's already full and she has no box that's partially filled, she will need one additional box for these remaining eggs.

So, the smallest number of boxes she needs to pack all the eggs is:

\[ 15 \text{ (full boxes) } + 1 \text{ (additional box for the remaining eggs) } = 16 \text{ boxes} \]

Therefore, Kim needs 16 boxes to pack all 94 eggs.

To find which number is equal to $\frac{3}{5}$, we can convert the fraction to a decimal. To do this, we divide the numerator by the denominator. 

So, we divide 3 by 5:

$3 \div 5 = 0.6$

Therefore, the decimal equivalent of $\frac{3}{5}$ is 0.6.

Looking at the options given:

[A] 0.8 is not equal to $\frac{3}{5}$.

[B] 0.6 is equal to $\frac{3}{5}$.

[C] 0.53 is not equal to $\frac{3}{5}$.

[D] 0.35 is not equal to $\frac{3}{5}$.

The correct answer is [B] 0.6.

\section{M052228}
To subtract two fractions, we need to have a common denominator. The denominators in the given fractions are 3 and 4, so we need to find a common multiple of these two numbers. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4 is 12. 

Once we have the LCM, we can convert both fractions to have the denominator of 12. To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the number that will give us the LCM as the new denominator.

For the first fraction $\frac{1}{3}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get $\frac{1 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{4}{12}$.

For the second fraction $\frac{1}{4}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get $\frac{1 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{3}{12}$.

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

$\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4 - 3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$.

So the correct method for finding $\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}$ is to have a common denominator and then subtract the numerators while keeping the common denominator. 

Looking at the options given:

[A] $\frac{1-1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because we do not subtract the denominators when subtracting fractions.

[B] $\frac{1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it only considers the denominators and not the numerators.

[C] $\frac{3-4}{3 \times 4}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the denominators in the wrong order (it should be the numerators that are subtracted, and the order matters).

[D] $\frac{4-3}{3 \times 4}$ is correct because it subtracts the numerators and multiplies the denominators, which is the correct process for subtracting fractions with different denominators.

Therefore, the correct answer is [D] $\frac{4-3}{3 \times 4}$.

To add these two numbers, we need to line up the decimal points and add each column, just like we would with whole numbers. 

$42.65$ has two decimal places.
$5.748$ has three decimal places.

To make the addition easier, we can add a zero to the end of $42.65$ to give it three decimal places as well, making it $42.650$.

Now we add the numbers column by column, starting from the right:

$42.650$
$+5.748$
$--------$
$48.398$

So, the answer is $48.398$.

Each person in the parade, regardless of being a boy or a girl, carried 2 balloons. Therefore, for each boy, there are 2 balloons, and for each girl, there are also 2 balloons.

If there were $m$ boys, then the total number of balloons carried by the boys would be $2m$ (since each boy carries 2 balloons). Similarly, if there were $n$ girls, then the total number of balloons carried by the girls would be $2n$.

To find the total number of balloons carried in the parade, we need to add the number of balloons carried by the boys to the number of balloons carried by the girls. This gives us $2m + 2n$ balloons in total.

However, we can factor out the 2 from both terms to simplify the expression, which gives us $2(m + n)$.

Therefore, the expression that represents the total number of balloons carried in the parade is $2(m + n)$.

The correct answer is:

[A] $2(m+n)$

\section{M032352}
To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the height of the bush and the length of its shadow. Let's look at the data given in the table:

- A 20 cm bush has a 16 cm shadow.
- A 40 cm bush has a 32 cm shadow.
- A 60 cm bush has a 48 cm shadow.
- An 80 cm bush has a 64 cm shadow.

From this, we can see that the shadow length is consistently 4 cm shorter than the height of the bush divided by 2. In other words, the shadow length is 0.8 times the height of the bush. This is because if we divide the shadow length by the bush height for each row, we get:

- \( \frac{16}{20} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{32}{40} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{48}{60} = 0.8 \)
- \( \frac{64}{80} = 0.8 \)

Now, we need to find the shadow length for a bush that is 50 cm tall. Using the relationship we've established, we can calculate this as follows:

Shadow length = \( 0.8 \times \) Bush height
Shadow length = \( 0.8 \times 50 \)
Shadow length = \( 40 \) cm

So, the shadow length of a bush that is 50 cm tall at 10 a.m. would be 40 cm. 

The correct answer is [C] $40 \mathrm{~cm}$.

The expression $2x + 3x$ represents the sum of two terms that are both multiples of $x$. When we combine like terms, we get $5x$. This means we are looking for a representation that would equal five times the length of $x$ when calculated.

Let's evaluate the options:

A. The length of this segment is $x + 5$, which is not the same as $5x$.

B. The length of this segment is $2 + 3 + x$, which simplifies to $5 + x$, not $5x$.

C. The area of this figure is $2 \times x + 3 \times x$, which simplifies to $2x + 3x$. This is exactly the expression we are looking for.

D. The area of this figure is $x \times 5 + x \times 5$, which simplifies to $5x + 5x$ or $10x$, which is not the same as $5x$.

Therefore, the correct representation of the expression $2x + 3x$ is:

C. The area of this figure.

\section{M032424}
To determine the weight of one metal block, we can analyze the information given by the two balance scale images.

In the first image, one metal block is heavier than the 8 grams on the other side of the balance scale. This means that the weight of one metal block is more than 8 grams.

In the second image, three metal blocks are lighter than the 20 grams on the other side of the balance scale. This means that the combined weight of the three metal blocks is less than 20 grams.

Now, let's use this information to eliminate the options:

[A] If one block weighed 5 grams, then three blocks would weigh 15 grams, which is less than 20 grams. This option is possible based on the second image, but it is not consistent with the first image, where one block is heavier than 8 grams.

[B] If one block weighed 6 grams, then three blocks would weigh 18 grams, which is also less than 20 grams. This option is possible based on the second image, but again, it is not consistent with the first image, where one block is heavier than 8 grams.

[C] If one block weighed 7 grams, then three blocks would weigh 21 grams, which is more than 20 grams. This option is not consistent with the second image, where three blocks are lighter than 20 grams.

[D] If one block weighed 8 grams, then three blocks would weigh 24 grams, which is more than 20 grams. This option is not consistent with the second image, where three blocks are lighter than 20 grams.

Given the analysis, the only possible weight for one block that is consistent with both images is more than 8 grams but less than 20 grams when combined for three blocks. Since none of the options [A], [C], or [D] fit this criteria, and option [B] is the only one that does, the weight of one metal block must be slightly more than 8 grams. However, since the options given do not include a weight that is more than 8 grams and less than 20 grams when tripled, there seems to be an inconsistency in the options provided based on the balance scale images.

If we strictly interpret the images and the options provided, none of the options [A], [C], or [D] can be correct, and option [B] is the closest to being correct, but it does not align with the first image. Therefore, based on the given options and the balance scale images, there is no correct answer. However, if we consider the possibility of an error and choose the closest correct option, [B] 6 grams would be the best choice, even though it contradicts the first image.

To find the value of $y$ when $t=9$, we can simply substitute the value of $t$ into the given formula and then perform the necessary calculations.

The formula given is:

\[y = 100 - \frac{100}{1+t}\]

Let's substitute $t=9$ into the formula:

\[y = 100 - \frac{100}{1+9}\]

Now, we need to calculate the value inside the fraction first:

\[1+9 = 10\]

So the formula becomes:

\[y = 100 - \frac{100}{10}\]

Now let's perform the division inside the fraction:

\[\frac{100}{10} = 10\]

Now we can subtract this result from 100:

\[y = 100 - 10\]

Finally, we perform the subtraction:

\[y = 90\]

Therefore, the value of $y$ when $t=9$ is 90.

Given that $t$ is a number between 6 and 9, we can express this as $6 < t < 9$. 

To find the range for $t+5$, we simply add 5 to each part of the inequality:

$6 + 5 < t + 5 < 9 + 5$

This simplifies to:

$11 < t + 5 < 14$

Therefore, $t+5$ is between 11 and 14.

The correct answer is [C] 11 and 14.

To simplify the expression $\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{x}{4}+\frac{x}{2}$, we need to find a common denominator for the three fractions. In this case, the denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common multiple of these denominators is 8, so we will use 8 as the common denominator.

Now we need to convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8. The first fraction, $\frac{3 x}{8}$, already has a denominator of 8, so we don't need to change it.

The second fraction, $\frac{x}{4}$, needs to be converted. To get a denominator of 8, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 (because 4 * 2 = 8). So, $\frac{x}{4}$ becomes $\frac{2x}{8}$.

The third fraction, $\frac{x}{2}$, also needs to be converted. To get a denominator of 8, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4 (because 2 * 4 = 8). So, $\frac{x}{2}$ becomes $\frac{4x}{8}$.

Now we can add the fractions together since they all have a common denominator:
$$\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{2x}{8}+\frac{4x}{8} = \frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8}.$$

We combine the numerators:
$$\frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8} = \frac{9x}{8}.$$

The expression is now simplified to $\frac{9x}{8}$.

The pattern that Pat is using seems to involve an increasing number of black tiles in the center of the square, forming smaller squares within the larger square. Each larger square has a side length that is one unit longer than the side of the black square inside it. For instance, the $3 \times 3$ square has a $1 \times 1$ black square, the $4 \times 4$ square has a $2 \times 2$ black square, and the $5 \times 5$ square has a $3 \times 3$ black square.

To find the number of red tiles for the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes, we need to subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles for each shape. The total number of tiles for a shape is the area of the square, which is the side length squared.

For the $6 \times 6$ shape:
- The total number of tiles is $6 \times 6 = 36$.
- The number of black tiles is the square of the side length of the black square inside it, which is $4 \times 4 = 16$ (as given in the table).
- So, the number of red tiles is the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles: $36 - 16 = 20$ red tiles.

For the $7 \times 7$ shape:
- The total number of tiles is $7 \times 7 = 49$.
- The number of black tiles is the square of the side length of the black square inside it, which is $5 \times 5 = 25$ (as given in the table).
- So, the number of red tiles is the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles: $49 - 25 = 24$ red tiles.

Now we can complete the table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\

\section{M032760A}
The pattern that Pat uses places black tiles in the center of the square, forming a smaller square, while the red tiles form the border. The number of black tiles corresponds to the number of tiles along one side of the inner black square, squared (since it's a square shape itself).

The $3 \times 3$ shape has a $1 \times 1$ black square (1 black tile), the $4 \times 4$ shape has a $2 \times 2$ black square (4 black tiles), and the $5 \times 5$ shape has a $3 \times 3$ black square (9 black tiles). We can see a pattern here: the number of black tiles is the square of the integer sequence 1, 2, 3, etc.

Given that the total number of tiles for the shape Pat made is 64, we can deduce that the shape is an $8 \times 8$ square because $8 \times 8 = 64$.

The pattern suggests that for an $n \times n$ square, the number of black tiles is $(n - 2) \times (n - 2)$. Thus, for an $8 \times 8$ square, the number of black tiles is $(8 - 2) \times (8 - 2) = 6 \times 6 = 36$.

Now, to find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 64 - 36
Number of red tiles = 28

So, for the $8 \times 8$ shape, there are 36 black tiles and 28 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
The pattern that Pat uses places black tiles in the center of the square shape, with the red tiles surrounding them. The number of black tiles seems to be related to the square of an integer, which corresponds to the size of the square shape. We can see this from the table:

- A $3 \times 3$ square has $1^2 = 1$ black tile.
- A $4 \times 4$ square has $2^2 = 4$ black tiles.
- A $5 \times 5$ square has $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

The pattern indicates that the number of black tiles in each square shape is the square of one less than the dimension of the shape (since the first shape is $3 \times 3$ and not $2 \times 2$).

Given that Pat made a shape with 49 black tiles, we can determine the size of the shape by finding the square root of 49:

$$ \sqrt{49} = 7 $$

So, the square shape that Pat made using 49 black tiles is a $8 \times 8$ square (since 7 black tiles correspond to the $7+1 = 8$ dimension square).

Now, to find the total number of tiles in an $8 \times 8$ square:

$$ 8 \times 8 = 64 $$

Since we already know there are 49 black tiles, we can find the number of red tiles by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

$$ 64 - 49 = 15 $$

Therefore, Pat used 15 red tiles in the $8 \times 8$ shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
From the table and the pattern shown in the images, we can see that the black tiles form a square in the center of the larger square made by the red tiles. The pattern for the number of black tiles seems to be the square of the integer sequence, where the first black square consists of $1^2 = 1$ black tile, the second $2^2 = 4$ black tiles, and the third $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

The number of red tiles is the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles. Since the shapes are square, the total number of tiles for a shape is the square of the length of its side.

For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there are $3^2 = 9$ total tiles.
For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are $4^2 = 16$ total tiles.
For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are $5^2 = 25$ total tiles.

Given that Pat used 44 red tiles for the next shape, we can deduce the size of the shape by finding the square number closest to but less than 44 (since there must be some black tiles as well). The square numbers near 44 are $6^2 = 36$ and $7^2 = 49$. Since 49 is too high (there would be no black tiles), Pat must have made a $7 \times 7$ shape and filled in some of the squares with red tiles that would otherwise be black.

The total number of tiles for a $7 \times 7$ shape is $7^2 = 49$. To find the number of black tiles, we subtract the number of red tiles from the total number of tiles:

Number of black tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of red tiles
Number of black tiles = 49 - 44
Number of black tiles = 5

So Pat would need 5 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
The pattern given for the number of black tiles in an $n \times n$ square is $(n-2)^2$. This is because the black tiles form a square that is two tiles smaller on each side than the overall square. For example, in the $3 \times 3$ square, there is only one black tile because $(3-2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$. In the $4 \times 4$ square, there are $4$ black tiles because $(4-2)^2 = 2^2 = 4$, and in the $5 \times 5$ square, there are $9$ black tiles because $(5-2)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.

The total number of tiles in an $n \times n$ square is $n^2$, since the square has $n$ tiles on each side. The number of red tiles would be the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles. Therefore, the number of red tiles can be calculated as $n^2 - (n-2)^2$.

Expanding the formula for the number of red tiles, we get:

$n^2 - (n-2)^2 = n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4 = 4n - 4$

So, the completed line for the $n \times n$ shape in the table would be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n-4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

This formula for the number of red tiles correctly reflects the pattern seen in the table: For $n = 3$, there are $4 \cdot 3 - 4 = 8$ red tiles, for $n = 4$, there are $4 \cdot 4 - 4 = 12$ red tiles, and for $n = 5$, there are $4 \cdot 5 - 4 = 16$ red tiles.

To find the equivalent expression to $4(3+x)$, we need to apply the distributive property. The distributive property states that for any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, the expression $a(b+c)$ is equal to $ab + ac$. 

Applying this to our expression, we get:

$4(3+x) = 4 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot x$

This simplifies to:

$12 + 4x$

Therefore, the equivalent expression is $12 + 4x$, which corresponds to option [C].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042086}
To find the value of $2a+2b+4$, we can use the given equation $a+b=25$. 

First, we can multiply both sides of the given equation by 2 to get a new equation that is similar to the one we want to find the value of. 

So, multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:
$2a + 2b = 2 \times 25$

This simplifies to:
$2a + 2b = 50$

Now, we have $2a+2b=50$, but we want to find the value of $2a+2b+4$. 

To do this, we can simply add 4 to both sides of the equation $2a + 2b = 50$:

$2a + 2b + 4 = 50 + 4$

This simplifies to:
$2a + 2b + 4 = 54$

Therefore, the value of $2a+2b+4$ is 54.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042103}
To solve this inequality, we need to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the inequality. To do that, we can start by subtracting $4x$ from both sides of the inequality to move the $x$ terms to one side. 

So we have:
\[9x - 6 - 4x < 4x + 4 - 4x\]

This simplifies to:
\[5x - 6 < 4\]

Next, we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side by adding 6 to both sides of the inequality:

\[5x - 6 + 6 < 4 + 6\]

This simplifies to:
\[5x < 10\]

Finally, we divide both sides by 5 to isolate $x$:

\[ \frac{5x}{5} < \frac{10}{5} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x < 2 \]

So the solution to the inequality is all values of $x$ that are less than 2.

The given sequence is a list of fractions where the numerator is one less than the denominator for each term. We can observe a pattern in the sequence:

- The first term has a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2.
- The second term has a numerator of 2 and a denominator of 3.
- The third term has a numerator of 3 and a denominator of 4.
- And so on.

This pattern suggests that the nth term of the sequence has a numerator of n and a denominator of n+1.

Therefore, to find the 100th term, we would follow this pattern:

- The numerator would be 100 (since it's the 100th term).
- The denominator would be 100 + 1, which is 101.

So, the 100th term in this sequence would be:

$$
\frac{100}{101}
$$
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042198C}
To find the $n$th term of the given sequence, let's examine the pattern in the fractions provided.

Looking at the numerators (the top numbers of the fractions), we see a clear pattern: they are increasing by 1 each time, starting from 1. So for the $n$th term, the numerator should be $n$.

Similarly, examining the denominators (the bottom numbers of the fractions), we see that they are also increasing by 1 each time, starting from 2. So for the $n$th term, the denominator should be $n+1$ (since the first term starts at 2, which is $1+1$).

Combining these observations, the $n$th term of the sequence would be $\frac{n}{n+1}$.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042226}
First, let's substitute the given values of $k$ and $l$ into the equation for $P$:

$P = \frac{3 k l}{5}$

$P = \frac{3 \cdot 7 \cdot 10}{5}$

Now, let's calculate the product of $3$, $7$, and $10$:

$3 \cdot 7 \cdot 10 = 21 \cdot 10 = 210$

Now we have:

$P = \frac{210}{5}$

To find $P$, we divide $210$ by $5$:

$P = 210 \div 5 = 42$

So the value of $P$ is $42$.

To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

We have the two equations:
1) $x + y = 12$
2) $2x + 5y = 36$

First, we can try to eliminate one of the variables by making the coefficients of either $x$ or $y$ the same in both equations. Let's eliminate $x$ by multiplying the first equation by 2:

$2(x + y) = 2(12)$
$2x + 2y = 24$

Now we have:
3) $2x + 2y = 24$
2) $2x + 5y = 36$

Subtract equation 3) from equation 2) to eliminate $x$:
$(2x + 5y) - (2x + 2y) = 36 - 24$
$2x + 5y - 2x - 2y = 12$
$3y = 12$

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for $y$:
$y = \frac{12}{3}$
$y = 4$

Now that we have the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find $x$:
$x + y = 12$
$x + 4 = 12$
$x = 12 - 4$
$x = 8$

So the values of $x$ and $y$ are $x=8$ and $y=4$, which corresponds to option [D].

\section{M042236}
To find the correct answer, we need to combine like terms in the expression $3 p^{2}+2 p+2 p^{2}+p$.

First, let's combine the terms that have $p^{2}$:
$3 p^{2} + 2 p^{2} = 5 p^{2}$

Next, let's combine the terms that have $p$:
$2 p + p = 3 p$

Now, we put these together to get the simplified expression:
$5 p^{2} + 3 p$

Therefore, the correct answer is [C] $5 p^{2}+3 p$.

Let's check each equation with both pairs of numbers to see which one is satisfied by both.

For the first pair $(0,-1)$:

[A] $x+y=-1$ becomes $0+(-1)=-1$, which is true.

[B] $2x+y=5$ becomes $2(0)+(-1)=5$, which is false because $-1 \neq 5$.

[C] $3x-y=0$ becomes $3(0)-(-1)=0$, which is true because $1=0$ is false.

[D] $4x-y=1$ becomes $4(0)-(-1)=1$, which is true because $1=1$.

So, from the first pair, options [A] and [D] could be correct. Now let's check the second pair $(1,3)$:

[A] $x+y=-1$ becomes $1+3=-1$, which is false because $4 \neq -1$.

[B] $2x+y=5$ becomes $2(1)+3=5$, which is true because $5=5$.

[C] $3x-y=0$ becomes $3(1)-3=0$, which is true because $0=0$.

[D] $4x-y=1$ becomes $4(1)-3=1$, which is true because $1=1$.

From the second pair, options [B], [C], and [D] could be correct. However, the only equation that is satisfied by both pairs of numbers is option [D] $4x-y=1$. 

Therefore, the correct answer is [D] $4x-y=1$.

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, we need to calculate the total area of the garden and subtract the area of the path.

The total area of the garden is given by the length times the width. The length is \(x\) meters and the width is \(x + 4\) meters, so the total area is \(x \times (x + 4) = x^2 + 4x\) square meters.

The path is 1 meter wide and runs along the length of the garden, which is \(x\) meters. Therefore, the area of the path is \(1 \times x = x\) square meters.

To find the area of the shaded portion, we subtract the area of the path from the total area of the garden:

Shaded area = Total area - Path area
Shaded area = \(x^2 + 4x - x\)
Shaded area = \(x^2 + 3x\)

The correct expression for the area of the shaded portion of the garden in square meters is [A] \(x^2 + 3x\).

\section{M052302}
To find the value of $y$, we need to substitute the given values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the equation.

Given:
$a = 8$
$b = 6$
$c = 2$

The equation is $y = \frac{a+b}{c}$.

Substitute the given values into the equation:
$y = \frac{8+6}{2}$.

Now, we calculate the numerator (the top part of the fraction):
$8 + 6 = 14$.

So the equation becomes:
$y = \frac{14}{2}$.

Now, we divide the numerator by the denominator (the bottom part of the fraction):
$14 \div 2 = 7$.

Therefore, the value of $y$ is 7.

The correct answer is [A] 7.

The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $A$ is the area and $s$ is the length of one side of the square.

Given that the area of the square is $144 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we can set up the equation $s^2 = 144$. To find the length of one side, we take the square root of both sides of the equation.

$s = \sqrt{144} = 12 \mathrm{~cm}$

Now that we know the length of one side of the square, we can find the perimeter. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula $P = 4s$, where $P$ is the perimeter and $s$ is the length of one side.

Substitute the value of $s$ into the formula:

$P = 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm}$

Therefore, the perimeter of the square is $48 \mathrm{~cm}$, which corresponds to option [B].

\section{M032324}
Let's denote the midpoint of segment $AB$ as $M$ and the midpoint of segment $BC$ as $N$. 

Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, the distance $AM$ is half of $AB$, which is $10 \text{ cm} / 2 = 5 \text{ cm}$. Similarly, since $N$ is the midpoint of $BC$, the distance $BN$ is half of $BC$, which is $5.2 \text{ cm} / 2 = 2.6 \text{ cm}$.

Now, the distance between the midpoints $M$ and $N$ is the sum of $AM$ and $BN$ because $B$ is between $A$ and $C$, and therefore $M$ and $N$ are on the same line with $B$ between them.

So, the distance between $M$ and $N$ is $5 \text{ cm} + 2.6 \text{ cm} = 7.6 \text{ cm}$.

Therefore, the correct answer is [D] $7.6 \mathrm{~cm}$.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032331}
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of degrees the minute hand turns through from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

First, let's consider how many degrees the minute hand moves in one minute. Since a clock face is a circle, and a circle has 360 degrees, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the minute hand moves through:

\[ \frac{360^{\circ}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 6^{\circ} \text{ per minute} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.:

From 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. is 40 minutes.
From 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. is 60 minutes.
So the total time is 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes.

Now we can calculate the total degrees the minute hand turns through in 100 minutes:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 6^{\circ} \text{ per minute} = 600^{\circ} \]

Therefore, the minute hand turns through 600 degrees from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., which corresponds to option [B] $600^{\circ}$.

To determine which transformations are needed to change Figure 1 into Figure 2 and then into Figure 3, let's analyze the figures and the transformations step by step.

From Figure 1 to Figure 2:
- The triangle in Figure 1 has its right angle at the bottom left corner, and the hypotenuse is on the top.
- In Figure 2, the right angle is at the top right corner, and the hypotenuse is on the bottom.
- This change can be achieved by a reflection over a vertical axis.

From Figure 2 to Figure 3:
- The right angle in Figure 2 is at the top right corner, and the hypotenuse is on the bottom.
- In Figure 3, the right angle is at the bottom left corner, and the hypotenuse is on the right side.
- This change can be achieved by a quarter turn (90 degrees) rotation clockwise.

Therefore, the transformations needed are a reflection and then a quarter turn rotation clockwise, which corresponds to option [B] reflection and then \(\frac{1}{4}\) turn rotation clockwise.

Let's denote the three consecutive whole numbers with the middle number being $2n$. 

The first number would then be $2n - 1$ (since it's one less than the middle number), the second number is $2n$, and the third number is $2n + 1$ (since it's one more than the middle number).

To find the sum of these three numbers, we simply add them together:

$$(2n - 1) + (2n) + (2n + 1)$$

Combining like terms, we get:

$$2n + 2n + 2n - 1 + 1$$

The $-1$ and $+1$ cancel each other out, so we're left with:

$$6n$$

Therefore, the sum of the three consecutive whole numbers with $2n$ as the middle number is $6n$.

The correct answer is [B] $6n$.

To solve for the value of \( x \) in the pattern shown in the image, let's look for a consistent relationship between the numbers.

Starting from the top row, we see the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. If we look at the second row, we have 6, 10, 14, which is also an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.

In the third row, we have 16 and 40, with the value of \( x \) in between. There should be a consistent arithmetic pattern here as well. Since the difference between 2 and 6 is 4, and the difference between 6 and 16 is 10, it seems that the difference is increasing by 6 each time.

To confirm this, let's check the difference between 16 and 40:

\( 40 - 16 = 24 \)

This fits our pattern: the difference started at 4, increased to 10, and now it's at 24. It's increasing by 6 each time (4, 10, 24), which suggests that the difference between the numbers before and after \( x \) should be 18 (since 24 - 6 = 18).

Now, we can find \( x \) by dividing the difference between 16 and 40 into two parts, which should be equal if the pattern is consistent:

\( 24 \div 2 = 12 \)

Adding 12 to 16 gives us the value for \( x \):

\( 16 + 12 = 28 \)

Therefore, the value of \( x \) in this pattern is 28.

The figure shows a rectangle with a right-angled triangle subtracted from one corner. To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle.

First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

The length of the rectangle is 16 cm and the width is 6 cm, so the area of the rectangle is:

\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 16 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Next, we calculate the area of the right-angled triangle. The area of a right-angled triangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

The base of the triangle is 8 cm and the height is 6 cm, so the area of the triangle is:

\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Now, we subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region:

\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of rectangle} - \text{Area of triangle} \]

\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 - 24 \, \text{cm}^2 = 72 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 72 cm², which corresponds to option [D].

To determine which image shows the result of a half-turn clockwise around point \( O \), we need to visualize rotating the original triangle 180 degrees around point \( O \).

In the original image, the triangle is pointing upwards and is located in the upper right quadrant relative to point \( O \). After a half-turn (which is 180 degrees) clockwise, the triangle should be pointing downwards and located in the lower left quadrant relative to point \( O \).

Looking at the options:

- Option A shows the triangle pointing downwards but it is in the upper left quadrant, which would be the result of a half-turn counter-clockwise, not clockwise.
- Option B shows the triangle pointing upwards and in the lower right quadrant, which is not the result of a half-turn in either direction.
- Option C shows the triangle pointing upwards and in the upper right quadrant, which is the original position of the triangle, not the result of any turn.
- Option D shows the triangle pointing downwards and in the lower left quadrant, which is the correct result of a half-turn clockwise around point \( O \).

Therefore, the correct answer is Option D.

To determine the largest number of books that will fit inside the box, we need to consider the dimensions of both the books and the box.

The books have dimensions of 20 cm x 15 cm x 6 cm, and the box has dimensions of 30 cm x 36 cm x 20 cm.

Let's consider how we can arrange the books inside the box to maximize the number of books that fit.

First, we will find out how many books can be placed along each dimension of the box:

- Along the 30 cm side of the box, we can place 30 cm / 15 cm = 2 books (since 15 cm is the width of the book).
- Along the 36 cm side of the box, we can place 36 cm / 20 cm = 1 book (since 20 cm is the length of the book), with 16 cm left over which is not enough for another book.
- Along the 20 cm height of the box, we can place 20 cm / 6 cm = 3 books (since 6 cm is the height of the book).

Now, we multiply the number of books that can fit along each dimension to find the total number of books that can be packed into the box:

2 books (along the 30 cm side) x 1 book (along the 36 cm side) x 3 books (along the 20 cm height) = 6 books in total.

Therefore, the largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 6.

To determine by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced by the NU Car Motor Company, we need to locate the point on the solid line that corresponds to the production of 150 cars.

First, find the horizontal line on the graph that represents 150 cars produced. This line intersects the y-axis at the 150 mark. Now, trace this line horizontally until it intersects with the solid line, which represents the actual car production.

Once you find the intersection point, trace a vertical line downwards from that point to the x-axis to find the corresponding time.

From the provided image, the intersection point is between 11 am and 12 noon, closer to 12 noon. It looks to be approximately three-quarters of the way between 11 am and 12 noon. Since each hour is divided into four segments on the graph, each segment would represent 15 minutes. Therefore, three-quarters of an hour would be approximately 45 minutes.

Thus, by estimating the position on the graph, it appears that a total of 150 cars had been produced by around 11:45 am.

To find the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up the total number of staff members across all the restaurants.
2. Divide the total number by the number of restaurants.

Let's do the calculation:

Step 1: Add up the number of staff members in each restaurant:
\[ 12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30 = 100 \]

Step 2: Divide the total number of staff members by the number of restaurants:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is 20.

The election results show that Pat received 80% of the votes, while Chris received 20% of the votes. 

If we were to ask a student at random about their vote, the probability that they voted for Pat is 80%, and the probability that they voted for Chris is 20%. 

Given that 80% is a high probability, it is more likely than not that a randomly selected student would have voted for Pat. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.

To find the total number of caps that are either white or green, we need to calculate the number of white caps and the number of green caps and then add them together.

According to the pie chart:
- White caps make up 30% of the total.
- Green caps make up 25% of the total.

Since there are 200 caps in total, we can calculate the number of white and green caps as follows:

White caps: 30% of 200 = 0.30 * 200 = 60 caps
Green caps: 25% of 200 = 0.25 * 200 = 50 caps

Now, we add the number of white caps to the number of green caps to get the total:

60 white caps + 50 green caps = 110 caps

Therefore, the total number of caps that are either white or green is 110.

The correct answer is [C] 110.

To maximize the product of two two-digit numbers, we should aim to have the larger digits in the tens place because the value of a digit in the tens place is ten times its value in the units place. Therefore, we want the two largest digits, 9 and 7, to be in the tens places of the two numbers.

Between 9 and 7, since 9 is the larger number, we should place it in the tens place of the number that will be multiplied by the larger units digit to maximize the product. The larger units digit, in this case, is 5 (since the remaining digits are 5 and 3), so we should pair 9 with 5 to get 95 as one of the numbers.

This leaves us with 7 and 3. Placing 7 in the tens place of the second number and 3 in the units place gives us 73. Therefore, the two numbers to be multiplied are 95 and 73.

Thus, the boxes should be filled as follows to get the greatest result:
\[ \boxed{9}\boxed{5} \times \boxed{7}\boxed{3} \]

\section{M042032}
To find the fraction equivalent to 0.125, we need to express 0.125 as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator.

0.125 has three decimal places, which means that the equivalent fraction will have a denominator of $10^3$ (since each decimal place represents a power of ten). Therefore, the denominator should be 1000.

Now, we need to find the numerator. Since 0.125 is the same as 125 thousandths, the numerator will be 125.

So, the fraction equivalent to 0.125 is $\frac{125}{1000}$.

However, this fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 125 in this case. 

$\frac{125}{1000} = \frac{125 \div 125}{1000 \div 125} = \frac{1}{8}$

But since we are looking for the equivalent fraction among the given options, we don't need to simplify it. The correct answer is the one that matches the unsimplified fraction $\frac{125}{1000}$.

Looking at the options:

[A] $\frac{125}{100}$ is not correct because the denominator should be 1000, not 100.
[B] $\frac{125}{1,000}$ is correct because it matches the fraction we found.
[C] $\frac{125}{10,000}$ is not correct because the denominator is too large.
[D] $\frac{125}{100,000}$ is not correct because the denominator is also too large.

Therefore, the correct answer is [B] $\frac{125}{1,000}$.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052214}
Let's evaluate each option step by step:

[A] $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50=50 \%$ of 3

To find $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$, we multiply $\frac{3}{10}$ by $50$:
$\frac{3}{10} \times 50 = \frac{3 \times 50}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$.

To find $50\%$ of $3$, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 and then multiply by $3$:
$50\% = \frac{50}{100} = \frac{1}{2}$, so $\frac{1}{2} \times 3 = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.

Comparing the two results, we see that $15 \neq 1.5$, so option [A] is not true.

[B] $3 \%$ of $50=6 \%$ of 100

To find $3\%$ of $50$, we convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by $50$:
$3\% = \frac{3}{100}$, so $\frac{3}{100} \times 50 = \frac{150}{100} = 1.5$.

To find $6\%$ of $100$, we convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by $100$:
$6\% = \frac{6}{100}$, so $\frac{6}{100} \times 100 = \frac{600}{100} = 6$.

Comparing the two results, we see that $1.5 \neq 6$, so option [B] is not true.

[C] $50 \div 30=30 \div 50$

To find $50 \div 30$, we divide $50$ by $30$:
$50 \div 30 = \frac{50}{30} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667$.

To find $30 \div 50$, we divide $30$ by $50$:
$30 \div 50 = \frac{30}{50} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6$.

Comparing the two results, we see that $1.6667 \neq 0.6$, so option [C] is not true.

[D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$

To find $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$, we multiply $\frac{3}{10}$ by $50$:
$\frac{3}{10} \times 50 = \frac{3 \times 50}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$.

To find $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$, we multiply $\frac{5}{10}$ by $30$:
$\frac{5}{10} \times 30 = \frac{5 \times 30}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15$.

Comparing the two results, we see that $15 = 15$, so option [D] is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is [D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$.

To determine the next term in the pattern, let's look at the sequence of fractions given:

$$
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{5}{6}
$$

Analyzing the pattern, we can observe that the numerator of each fraction is increasing by 1, starting from 1. Similarly, the denominator of each fraction is also increasing by 1, starting from 2. 

The sequence of numerators is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
The sequence of denominators is: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

So, the next numerator after 5 would be 5 + 1 = 6, and the next denominator after 6 would be 6 + 1 = 7. 

Therefore, the next term in the pattern is:

$$
\frac{6}{7}
$$

To find the sum of all the interior angles of a polygon, you can use the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°

where n is the number of sides of the polygon.

In this case, the polygon is a pentagon, which has 5 sides. So we will plug n = 5 into the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 3 × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 540°

Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of pentagon ABCDE is 540 degrees.

To locate the points B and C on the graph, we'll follow the instructions given for point P, using their respective distances from the origin O and the angles of rotation from the baseline OA.

1. For point B(3,30°):
   - We find the 30° line on the graph which is just to the right of the baseline OA.
   - We then count outwards from the origin O along the 30° line until we reach the third circle, which represents a distance of 3 units from the origin.

2. For point C(4,120°):
   - We find the 120° line on the graph which is to the left of the baseline OA, one-third of the way around the circle from the baseline.
   - We count outwards from the origin O along the 120° line until we reach the fourth circle, which represents a distance of 4 units from the origin.

Now, to draw the angle BOC, we will connect points B and C to the origin O with straight lines.

The measure of angle BOC is the difference between the angles from the baseline OA to each point. Point C is at 120° and point B is at 30°. To find the measure of the angle BOC, we subtract the smaller angle from the larger one:

Angle BOC = 120° - 30° = 90°

Therefore, angle BOC measures 90°.

Since I'm unable to physically mark the points or draw on the image, please follow the steps described to mark and connect the points B and C on your copy of the graph.

To determine how many times Steve should expect the arrow to land on the red sector, we need to look at the proportion of the spinner that is red.

From the image, we can see that the spinner is divided into 5 equal sectors, one for each color: orange, green, blue, red, and purple. Since the sectors are equal, the probability of landing on any one color is the same for each spin.

Since there are 5 equal sectors, the probability of landing on red for any given spin is 1/5. To find out how many times out of 600 spins we would expect the spinner to land on red, we multiply the total number of spins by the probability of landing on red:

600 spins * (1/5 probability of red) = 600/5 = 120 spins

However, this number is not one of the options provided. It seems there might be an error in the question or the provided choices. If we assume that the options are correct, none of them match the calculated expectation of 120 spins. Could you please double-check the question or the options provided?

To find the median of a set of numbers, you need to arrange the numbers in ascending order and then find the middle number. If there is an odd number of values in the set, the median is the middle number. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

Here, we have an odd number of restaurants (5), so the median will be the middle number once we arrange the staff numbers in ascending order.

The numbers of staff members are already given in ascending order: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30.

Since there are 5 numbers, the middle one will be the third number (because there are two numbers on either side of it), which is 19.

Therefore, the median number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is 19.

Since Sue puts the red marble back into the bag after drawing it, the composition of the bag remains unchanged. There are still 5 red marbles and 5 blue marbles in the bag, making a total of 10 marbles.

The probability of drawing a red marble from the bag is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles. 

So, the probability is:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of red marbles}}{\text{Total number of marbles}} = \frac{5}{10} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Therefore, the probability that the next marble Sue draws is red is $\frac{1}{2}$.

The correct answer is:

[A] $\frac{1}{2}$

The cost of hiring a taxi consists of two parts: the basic charge and the charge per kilometer driven.

The basic charge is a fixed amount that does not depend on the distance traveled. This is given as 25 zeds.

The charge per kilometer is the amount that is added to the basic charge for each kilometer driven. This is given as 0.2 zeds per kilometer.

For a trip of $n$ kilometers, the total cost would be the basic charge plus the charge per kilometer multiplied by the number of kilometers driven.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:
Total Cost = Basic Charge + (Charge per Kilometer × Number of Kilometers)

Substituting the given values, we get:
Total Cost = 25 + (0.2 × n)

Therefore, the correct representation of the cost in zeds to hire a taxi for a trip of $n$ kilometers is:

[A] $25+0.2 n$

The expression $xy+1$ can be broken down into two parts: $xy$ and $+1$.

The $xy$ part indicates the multiplication of $x$ and $y$. There are no parentheses around $y+1$, so we do not add 1 to $y$ before multiplying by $x$. This eliminates option [A].

The $+1$ part indicates that after the multiplication of $x$ and $y$, we add 1 to the result. This means we are not simply multiplying $x$ and $y$ by 1, which eliminates option [B].

Option [C] suggests adding $x$ to $y$ first and then adding 1, but the expression does not have a plus sign between $x$ and $y$, so we are not adding $x$ and $y$ together. This eliminates option [C].

Option [D] states that we multiply $x$ by $y$ and then add 1, which correctly describes the operation indicated by the expression $xy+1$. Therefore, the correct answer is:

[D] Multiply $x$ by $y$, then add 1.

To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply its length by its width. In this case, the length is given as \( x + 2 \) and the width is given as \( x \).

So, the area \( A \) of the rectangle is calculated as follows:

\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ A = (x + 2) \times x \]
\[ A = x \times x + 2 \times x \]
\[ A = x^2 + 2x \]

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \( x^2 + 2x \), which corresponds to option [B].

\section{M052002}
To find the length of the longest piece, we first need to determine the value of $x$. We can do this by setting up an equation that represents the total length of the wood before it was cut. The total length of the wood is given as 40 cm, and the three pieces it was cut into are represented by the expressions $2x-5$, $x+7$, and $x+6$. 

So, we can write the equation:
\[2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[4x + 8 = 40\]

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:
\[4x = 32\]

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[x = 8\]

Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the lengths of each piece by substituting the value of $x$ into the expressions.

For the first piece:
\[2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \text{ cm}\]

For the second piece:
\[x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \text{ cm}\]

For the third piece:
\[x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ cm}\]

Comparing the lengths of the three pieces, we can see that the second piece is the longest with a length of 15 cm.

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of the angles in the triangles shown in the figure.

First, let's look at the large triangle on the right. We can see that one angle is \( 30^\circ \) and another angle is \( x \). Since the sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \), the third angle in this large triangle must be \( 180^\circ - 30^\circ - x \).

Now let's consider the smaller triangle on the left. We can see that one angle is \( 45^\circ \) and another angle is \( 65^\circ \). The sum of these two angles is \( 45^\circ + 65^\circ = 110^\circ \). Therefore, the third angle in this smaller triangle, which is also the angle adjacent to the \( x \) angle in the large triangle, must be \( 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ \).

Since the third angle in the large triangle and the third angle in the smaller triangle are adjacent and form a straight line, their sum must be \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we have:

\( 180^\circ - 30^\circ - x + 70^\circ = 180^\circ \)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\( 220^\circ - x = 180^\circ \)

Subtracting \( 220^\circ \) from both sides, we find:

\( -x = -40^\circ \)

Multiplying both sides by \( -1 \), we get:

\( x = 40^\circ \)

So the value of \( x \) is \( 40^\circ \), which corresponds to option [B].

The volume of a rectangular box (also known as a rectangular prism) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

From the image, we have:
- The width of the box is \(5 \text{ cm}\)
- The height of the box is \(4 \text{ cm}\)
- The length of the box is \(x \text{ cm}\)
- The volume of the box is given as \(200 \text{ cm}^3\)

Using the volume formula:

\[ 200 \text{ cm}^3 = x \text{ cm} \times 5 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm} \]

To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by the product of the width and height:

\[ x = \frac{200 \text{ cm}^3}{5 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm}} \]

\[ x = \frac{200 \text{ cm}^3}{20 \text{ cm}^2} \]

\[ x = 10 \text{ cm} \]

So the value of \(x\) is 10 cm.

The machine started with an equal number of blue, pink, yellow, and green candies. Since there are 100 candies in total and 4 different colors, there must be 25 candies of each color.

After Megan turned the lever, she obtained a pink candy. This means there are now 24 pink candies left and 99 candies in total.

The probability that Peter will get a pink candy is the number of pink candies left divided by the total number of candies left. So, the probability is 24/99.

Before Megan turned the lever, the probability of getting a pink candy was 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25.

After Megan turned the lever, the probability of getting a pink candy is 24/99, which is approximately 0.2424.

Comparing the probabilities, 0.25 (before Megan turned the lever) is greater than 0.2424 (after Megan turned the lever).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

To find out how many bottles of the regular size the shopkeeper should order, we need to calculate $50\%$ of the total order of 1,200 bottles.

$50\%$ is the same as $0.5$ in decimal form. So, we can multiply the total number of bottles by $0.5$ to find out how many should be of the regular size.

$1,200 \times 0.5 = 600$

Therefore, the shopkeeper should order 600 bottles of the regular size soda.

The correct answer is [C] 600.

The image provided shows two population pyramids for Country X and Country Y, which represent the age structure of each country's population. Country X has a broad base that narrows sharply towards the top, indicating a large young population and a smaller elderly population. This structure is typical of a rapidly growing population. On the other hand, Country Y has a more uniform distribution across age groups with a bulge in the middle, indicating a slow-growing population with a relatively larger proportion of middle-aged and elderly individuals.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for several reasons:

1. Proportion of elderly: The population pyramid for Country Y shows a larger proportion of the population in the older age bracket (ages 45-89) compared to Country X. This suggests that Country Y has a relatively larger elderly population that will require care and support.

2. Shrinking younger workforce: The pyramid for Country Y does not have a broad base, which indicates that there are fewer young people entering the workforce. This smaller group of young and middle-aged people will be responsible for supporting the larger elderly population, which can strain resources and social support systems.

3. Dependency ratio: With a larger elderly population and a smaller working-age population, Country Y is likely to have a higher dependency ratio, meaning that the number of people not in the workforce (children and the elderly) is high relative to those who are working. This can lead to financial and social challenges as fewer workers are available to support the non-working population through taxes and caregiving.

In summary, Country Y's age structure indicates an aging population with a smaller base of younger individuals to support the elderly, which can present significant challenges in providing adequate care and resources for the aging population.
-------------------------------------------
