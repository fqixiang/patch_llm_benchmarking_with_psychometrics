Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions together. Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before we can add them. The easiest common denominator to use here is 1000 since 100 is a factor of 1000. 

First, we convert $\frac{4}{100}$ to a fraction with a denominator of 1000. To do this, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to get $\frac{40}{1000}$.

Now we have two fractions with the same denominator:
$\frac{40}{1000} + \frac{3}{1000}$

When we add these together, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:
$\frac{40 + 3}{1000} = \frac{43}{1000}$

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
$43 ÷ 1000 = 0.043$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[A] 0.043

Thought process and reasoning:
To estimate the value of $\frac{7.21 \times 3.86}{10.09}$, we can round each number to the nearest whole number to make the calculation easier. 

$7.21$ is closest to $7$, $3.86$ is closest to $4$, and $10.09$ is closest to $10$. 

Now we can substitute these rounded numbers into the original expression to get an estimate:

$\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$

This corresponds to option [B].

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the total number of white or green caps, we need to add the percentage of white caps to the percentage of green caps and then calculate that percentage of the total number of caps.

White caps make up 30% of the total, and green caps make up 25% of the total. Adding these percentages together gives us:

30% (white) + 25% (green) = 55% (white or green)

Now, we need to find 55% of 200 caps:

55% of 200 = 0.55 * 200 = 110

Therefore, the total number of caps that are either white or green is 110.

Answer: [C] 110

\section{M032626}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. 

Step 1: Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if 36 is divisible by 2. 
- 36 divided by 2 is 18, so 2 is a prime factor of 36.

Step 2: Continue with the number 18 and see if it is divisible by 2. 
- 18 divided by 2 is 9, so another 2 is a prime factor of 36.

Step 3: Now we have 9, which is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.
- 9 divided by 3 is 3, so 3 is a prime factor of 36.

Step 4: We are left with the number 3, which is a prime number itself, so it is also a prime factor of 36.

Putting it all together, 36 can be expressed as the product of its prime factors as $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

\section{M032662}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of multiplying fractions. When two fractions that are both less than 1 are multiplied together, the result is smaller than either of the original fractions. This is because a fraction represents a part of a whole, and when you take a part of a part, you end up with a smaller piece.

Looking at the number line in the first image, we see that both P and Q are between 0 and 1, which means they are fractions less than 1. Therefore, when we multiply P and Q, the result N should be a number that is smaller than both P and Q.

Now, let's look at the options provided in the second image:

A. Shows N to the right of 1, which is incorrect because N should be less than P and Q.
B. Shows N between Q and 1, which is incorrect for the same reason.
C. Shows N between P and Q, which is incorrect because the product of two numbers less than 1 should be less than either of the numbers.
D. Shows N to the left of P, which is the correct position because N should be smaller than both P and Q.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

This is a free-text response question.

To convert $3 \frac{5}{6}$ to decimal form, we first need to convert the fractional part to decimal form and then add it to the whole number part.

Step 1: Convert the fractional part $\frac{5}{6}$ to decimal. To do this, we divide 5 by 6. 

Step 2: $5 \div 6 = 0.8333...$ 

Step 3: Since we need to round to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal place. The third decimal place is a '3', which does not require us to round up the second decimal place. Therefore, the rounded decimal form of the fractional part is 0.83.

Step 4: Add the whole number part to the decimal. The whole number part is 3.

Step 5: $3 + 0.83 = 3.83$

\section{M042002}
This is a free-text response question.

To maximize the product of two two-digit numbers, you'll want to put the highest digits in the tens place because the tens place has a greater value than the ones place. Therefore, you should start by placing the two largest numbers, 9 and 7, in the tens places.

Next, you have the digits 5 and 3 left for the ones places. To get the largest product, you want to multiply larger numbers by larger numbers. Therefore, it's best to pair the larger of the remaining numbers (5) with the larger of the tens place numbers (9), and the smaller with the smaller.

So, the number with 9 in the tens place should have 5 in the ones place, making it 95. The number with 7 in the tens place should have 3 in the ones place, making it 73.

The two numbers to be multiplied should be 95 and 73 for the greatest result.

- Recognize that the table shows powers of 4 and their corresponding values.
- Identify the powers of 4 that correspond to the values 256 and 4,096 in the table.
- Use the properties of exponents to multiply these powers of 4 together.
- Compare the result with the given options to select the correct answer.

Answer:
- From the table, $256$ corresponds to $4^{4}$ and $4,096$ corresponds to $4^{6}$.
- To multiply these together, we add the exponents because the bases are the same: $4^{4} \times 4^{6} = 4^{4+6} = 4^{10}$.
- Therefore, the value of $256 \times 4,096$ expressed as a power of 4 is $4^{10}$.

\section{M042031}
Type of question: Multiple choice

Thought process and reasoning:
To find the value of the square that will make the two fractions equivalent, we need to find a common factor or use cross-multiplication.

First, simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us $\frac{2}{7}$.

Now, we need to find a number that, when placed in the square and divided by 21, gives us the same value as $\frac{2}{7}$. 

To find this number, we can multiply the numerator of the simplified fraction by the denominator of the fraction we are trying to find the equivalent for. So, we multiply 2 by 21.

$2 \times 21 = 42$

Now, we divide this product by the denominator of the simplified fraction, which is 7.

$42 \div 7 = 6$

So, the value of the square that makes the two fractions equivalent is 6.

Answer: [A] 6

\section{M042032}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the fraction equivalent to 0.125, we need to express 0.125 as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator. Since 0.125 has three decimal places, we can write it as a fraction with a denominator of 1000 to account for those three places (because 0.125 is the same as 125/1000). 

Now, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor. In this case, 125 and 1000 can both be divided by 125. 

125 ÷ 125 = 1
1000 ÷ 125 = 8

So, 0.125 is equivalent to the fraction 1/8.

Now let's look at the options to see which one matches:

[A] $\frac{125}{100}$ is not correct because it equals 1.25.
[B] $\frac{125}{1,000}$ is correct because it simplifies to 1/8.
[C] $\frac{125}{10,000}$ is not correct because it would equal 0.0125.
[D] $\frac{125}{100,000}$ is not correct because it would equal 0.00125.

2. To find the length of the original pipe, we need to determine what length would result in 3 meters being $\frac{1}{5}$ of it.
3. We can set up the equation $\frac{1}{5} \times \text{original length} = 3 \text{ meters}$.
4. To solve for the original length, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5, which is the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{5}$.
5. This gives us $\text{original length} = 3 \text{ meters} \times 5 = 15 \text{ meters}$.

To complete the missing boxes, we need to calculate the percentage of successful shots for James and the number of successful shots for Andrew.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of successful shots for James.
James made 15 successful shots out of 20 attempts. To find the percentage, we divide the number of successful shots by the total number of attempts and then multiply by 100.

\[ \frac{15}{20} \times 100 = 75\% \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of successful shots for Andrew.
Andrew made 80% successful shots out of 20 attempts. To find the number of successful shots, we convert the percentage to a fraction and multiply by the total number of attempts.

\[ \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 16 \]

So James had a 75% success rate, and Andrew made 16 successful shots out of 20.

Answer:
- For James: [75%].
- For Andrew: [16 out of 20].

Second, to solve this, we need to identify the pattern in the given equations. It seems that the first number is always 3, and the second number is decreasing by 1 each time, starting from 3. The result of the subtraction is the difference between 3 and the second number.

In the first line, $3 - 3 = 0$ because the second number is 3 and the difference between 3 and 3 is 0.
In the second line, $3 - 2 = 1$ because the second number is 2 and the difference between 3 and 2 is 1.
In the third line, $3 - 1 = 2$ because the second number is 1 and the difference between 3 and 1 is 2.
In the fourth line, $3 - 0 = 3$ because the second number is 0 and the difference between 3 and 0 is 3.

Third, following this pattern, the next line should decrease the second number by 1 again, which would make it -1 (since 0 - 1 = -1). Then the equation would be $3 - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4$.

This is a free-text response question.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of 6 eggs each can be made out of 94 eggs, and if there will be any eggs left over that would require an additional box.

First, we divide 94 eggs by the number of eggs that can fit in one box, which is 6.

\[ \frac{94}{6} = 15 \text{ remainder } 4 \]

This means that Kim can fill 15 boxes completely, and she will have 4 eggs left over.

Since she can't put these 4 eggs into a box that's already full, and she can't leave them unpacked, she will need one more box for these remaining eggs.

So, the smallest number of boxes Kim needs to pack all the eggs is 15 full boxes plus 1 additional box for the remaining eggs.

[A] To check if $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$ equals $50\%$ of $3$, we calculate both sides. $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$ is $0.3 \times 50 = 15$. $50\%$ of $3$ is $0.5 \times 3 = 1.5$. These two values are not equal, so option [A] is not correct.

[B] To check if $3\%$ of $50$ equals $6\%$ of $100$, we calculate both sides. $3\%$ of $50$ is $0.03 \times 50 = 1.5$. $6\%$ of $100$ is $0.06 \times 100 = 6$. These two values are not equal, so option [B] is not correct.

[C] To check if $50 \div 30$ equals $30 \div 50$, we calculate both sides. $50 \div 30$ is approximately $1.6667$. $30 \div 50$ is $0.6$. These two values are not equal, so option [C] is not correct.

[D] To check if $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ equals $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$, we calculate both sides. $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ is $5 \times 3 = 15$. $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$ is $3 \times 5 = 15$. These two values are equal, so option [D] is correct.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 4 is their product, which is 12. We then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator of 12. 

For the first fraction, $\frac{1}{3}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get $\frac{4}{12}$. 

For the second fraction, $\frac{1}{4}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get $\frac{3}{12}$. 

Now we can subtract the two fractions: $\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12}$. 

When subtracting fractions with the same denominator, we subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same. So, $\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4-3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$. 

Looking at the options, the correct method is the one that shows the numerators being subtracted and the denominators being multiplied, which is:

Thought process and reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the height of the bush and the length of the shadow. From the table, we can see that as the height of the bush doubles, the length of the shadow also doubles. This suggests a direct proportionality between the height of the bush and the length of the shadow.

We can use the data from the table to find the ratio of the shadow length to the bush height. For example, for the first row:
Shadow length / Bush height = 16 cm / 20 cm = 0.8

We can check if this ratio is consistent for the other rows:
- For the second row: 32 cm / 40 cm = 0.8
- For the third row: 48 cm / 60 cm = 0.8
- For the fourth row: 64 cm / 80 cm = 0.8

The ratio is consistent across all rows, so we can use this ratio to find the shadow length for a bush height of 50 cm:
Shadow length = Bush height * Ratio
Shadow length = 50 cm * 0.8
Shadow length = 40 cm

The expression given is $2x + 3x$, which simplifies to $5x$. This means we are looking for a representation that combines two parts that are proportional to $x$ in such a way that their combined measure is equivalent to 5 times the measure of $x$.

Option A shows a segment with lengths $x$ and $5$, which does not represent $5x$ because it suggests $x + 5$ rather than $5x$.

Option B shows a segment divided into parts with lengths $2$, $3$, and $x$. This does not represent $5x$ either, as it suggests $2 + 3 + x$ rather than $5x$.

Option C shows a rectangle with one side of length $x$ and the other side divided into lengths $2$ and $3$. The area of this rectangle would be $x \times (2 + 3)$, which is $x \times 5$ or $5x$. This correctly represents the expression $5x$.

Option D shows a rectangle with sides of length $x$ and $5$. The area of this rectangle would be $x \times 5$ or $5x$, which also correctly represents the expression $5x$.

However, since the original expression was $2x + 3x$, which implies a sum of two quantities each proportional to $x$, option C is a more direct representation of this sum, as it visually separates the two quantities (2 and 3) that are being multiplied by $x$.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

In the second image, three metal blocks are lighter than 20 grams because the side with the blocks is higher than the side with the weights totaling 20 grams.

Since we know that three blocks are lighter than 20 grams, we can determine that one block must be lighter than 20/3 grams, which is approximately 6.67 grams. Therefore, the weight of one block must be less than 6.67 grams, but more than 8 grams.

Given the options:

[A] $5 \mathrm{~g}$ - This is too light because one block is heavier than 8 grams.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to consider two parts of the cost: the basic charge and the charge per kilometer.

The basic charge is a fixed amount, which is 25 zeds. This does not change regardless of the distance traveled.

The charge per kilometer is variable and depends on the distance traveled. Since the charge is 0.2 zeds per kilometer, for $n$ kilometers, the charge would be $0.2n$ zeds.

The total cost of the trip would be the sum of the basic charge and the charge per kilometer. Therefore, the cost in zeds for a trip of $n$ kilometers would be the basic charge (25 zeds) plus the charge per kilometer ($0.2n$ zeds).

Mathematically, this is represented as:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Basic Charge} + (\text{Charge per Kilometer} \times \text{Number of Kilometers}) \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 25 + (0.2 \times n) \]

Looking at the options provided:

[A] $25+0.2 n$ - This option correctly represents the basic charge plus the charge per kilometer for $n$ kilometers.

[B] $25 \times 0.2 n$ - This option incorrectly multiplies the basic charge by the charge per kilometer, which is not the correct approach.

[C] $0.2 \times(25+n)$ - This option incorrectly multiplies the charge per kilometer by the sum of the basic charge and the number of kilometers, which is not the correct approach.

[D] $0.2 \times 25+n$ - This option incorrectly multiplies the charge per kilometer by the basic charge and then adds the number of kilometers, which is not the correct approach.

2. Perform the operations following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply these steps:

1. Substitute \( t = 9 \) into the formula: 
\( y = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + 9} \)

2. Calculate the denominator of the fraction:
\( 1 + 9 = 10 \)

3. Rewrite the formula with the calculated denominator:
\( y = 100 - \frac{100}{10} \)

4. Perform the division inside the fraction:
\( \frac{100}{10} = 10 \)

5. Subtract this value from 100:
\( y = 100 - 10 \)

This question is a free-text response question.

To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. All the terms in the expression are 'x' terms, so they can be combined. However, they have different denominators, so we need to find a common denominator to combine them. The denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common denominator (LCD) for these is 8.

The first term is already over 8, so it remains $\frac{3x}{8}$.

The second term is $\frac{x}{4}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{2x}{8}$ when we multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the common denominator of 8.

The third term is $\frac{x}{2}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{4x}{8}$ when we multiply the numerator and denominator by 4 to get the common denominator of 8.

Now that we have a common denominator, we can combine the numerators:

$\frac{3x}{8} + \frac{2x}{8} + \frac{4x}{8} = \frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8} = \frac{9x}{8}$.

So the expression simplifies to $\frac{9x}{8}$.

First, let's observe the pattern in the number of black tiles. It seems that the number of black tiles follows the sequence of square numbers: $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, and $3^2 = 9$. The next square numbers in the sequence are $4^2 = 16$ and $5^2 = 25$. These are already filled in the table for the $6 \times 6$ and $7 \times 7$ shapes, respectively.

Next, we need to find the number of red tiles. We can do this by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles in the shape.

For a $6 \times 6$ shape, the total number of tiles is $6 \times 6 = 36$. We already know there are 16 black tiles, so the number of red tiles is $36 - 16 = 20$.

For a $7 \times 7$ shape, the total number of tiles is $7 \times 7 = 49$. We already know there are 25 black tiles, so the number of red tiles is $49 - 25 = 24$.

Finally, we fill in the total number of tiles for each shape which is the sum of the black and red tiles, but since it's a square, it's just the square of the side length.

The completed table is:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Therefore, the number of red tiles for the $6 \times 6$ shape is 20, and for the $7 \times 7$ shape, it is 24. The total number of tiles for the $6 \times 6$ shape is 36, and for the $7 \times 7$ shape, it is 49.

To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. Looking at the table, we see that the shapes are increasing by one tile on each side, which means a shape with a total of 64 tiles would be an $8 \times 8$ square.

The pattern for the number of black tiles seems to be that they are in the center of the square and form a smaller square themselves. We can infer from the images and the table that:

- A $3 \times 3$ square has $1^2 = 1$ black tile.
- A $4 \times 4$ square has $2^2 = 4$ black tiles.
- A $5 \times 5$ square has $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

Following this pattern, an $8 \times 8$ square would have a center made up of a $6 \times 6$ square of black tiles because $8 - 2 = 6$ (the subtraction of 2 accounts for the border of red tiles). So the number of black tiles would be $6^2 = 36$.

The total number of tiles in an $8 \times 8$ square is $8^2 = 64$. If 36 of these are black, then the remaining tiles would be red. Therefore, the number of red tiles would be $64 - 36 = 28$.

So, for an $8 \times 8$ shape with a total of 64 tiles, there would be 36 black tiles and 28 red tiles.

Answer: Black tiles: 36, Red tiles: 28.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
Type of question: Free text response.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the number of black tiles and the size of the square, and then use this relationship to find the number of red tiles for the square with 49 black tiles.

The given shapes show a pattern in the number of black tiles:
- $3 \times 3$ shape has 1 black tile, which is $1^2$.
- $4 \times 4$ shape has 4 black tiles, which is $2^2$.
- $5 \times 5$ shape has 9 black tiles, which is $3^2$.

We can see that the number of black tiles is the square of an integer, which corresponds to the number of tiles along one side of the inner black square. This means that for a shape with 49 black tiles, we are dealing with a square of $7^2$ black tiles, because $7 \times 7 = 49$.

To find the total size of the shape that contains 49 black tiles, we need to add the border of red tiles. Since the pattern is consistent, we add 2 to the dimension of the black square to get the overall size of the shape. So, the shape with 49 black tiles is a $9 \times 9$ square.

Now, to find the number of red tiles:
- The total number of tiles in a $9 \times 9$ shape is $9^2 = 81$.
- Subtract the number of black tiles from the total to find the number of red tiles: $81 - 49 = 32$ red tiles.

So, Pat used 32 red tiles in the shape that has 49 black tiles.

Answer: 32 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
From the table and the images provided, we can see a pattern in the arrangement of black and red tiles. The black tiles form a square in the center of the larger square shape, and the number of black tiles increases as a square of the side length of the black tile square. Specifically, for a $n \times n$ square shape, the center consists of a $(n-2) \times (n-2)$ square of black tiles, and the rest are red tiles.

For the $3 \times 3$ shape, we have a $1 \times 1$ black square.
For the $4 \times 4$ shape, we have a $2 \times 2$ black square.
For the $5 \times 5$ shape, we have a $3 \times 3$ black square.

Following this pattern, we can determine the size of the shape that Pat made with 44 red tiles by examining the number of red tiles in each shape:

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there are 8 red tiles (1 layer of red tiles around the black square).
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 12 red tiles (2 layers of red tiles around the black square).
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 16 red tiles (3 layers of red tiles around the black square).

We notice that the number of red tiles increases by 4 as the total size of the shape increases by 1. This is because each additional layer around the black square adds 4 more red tiles (one on each side of the square).

To find the shape that would use 44 red tiles, let's see how many more red tiles are needed from the $5 \times 5$ shape to reach 44:

44 red tiles - 16 red tiles (from the $5 \times 5$ shape) = 28 additional red tiles

Since each additional layer adds 4 red tiles, we divide the additional red tiles needed by 4 to find the number of additional layers:

28 additional red tiles / 4 red tiles per layer = 7 additional layers

The $5 \times 5$ shape already has 3 layers, so adding 7 more layers gives us:

3 layers + 7 layers = 10 layers total

The total number of layers corresponds to the size of the square shape. Since the $5 \times 5$ shape corresponds to 3 layers, we add 7 to the side length of 5 to get the side length of the new shape:

5 (side length of the $5 \times 5$ shape) + 7 (additional layers) = 12

Therefore, the shape using 44 red tiles is a $12 \times 12$ square.

Now, we need to determine the number of black tiles needed to complete the shape. The black tiles form a square in the center, and since we have a $12 \times 12$ square, the black square in the center will be $10 \times 10$ (two less than the total side length, as per the pattern we've observed).

The number of black tiles needed is the area of the black square:

$10 \times 10 = 100$ black tiles

So, Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
This is a free text response question.

To find the pattern for the number of red tiles, let's analyze the given data:

- For a $3 \times 3$ shape, there are $1$ black tile and $8$ red tiles.
- For a $4 \times 4$ shape, there are $4$ black tiles and $12$ red tiles.
- For a $5 \times 5$ shape, there are $9$ black tiles and $16$ red tiles.

The number of black tiles forms a pattern that follows the formula $(n-2)^2$, where $n$ is the size of the square. This formula is given in the question.

To find the total number of tiles for an $n \times n$ shape, we simply calculate $n^2$ because a square with side length $n$ has $n \times n$ tiles in total.

Since we know the number of black tiles $(n-2)^2$, we can subtract this from the total number of tiles $n^2$ to find the number of red tiles:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n-2)^2$

Now, let's expand $(n-2)^2$:

$(n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4$

Substitute this back into the formula for the number of red tiles:

Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4)$
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4$
Number of red tiles = $4n - 4$

So the number of red tiles for an $n \times n$ shape is $4n - 4$.

Now, let's complete the table with this information:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n - 4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Therefore, the completed line for shape $n \times n$ in the table is:

Number of Black Tiles: $(n-2)^{2}$
Number of Red Tiles: $4n - 4$
Total Number of Tiles: $n^2$

We can multiply the entire equation $a + b = 25$ by 2 to get $2a + 2b = 50$. 

Then we can add 4 to both sides of the equation to get $2a + 2b + 4 = 50 + 4$.

Thought process and reasoning:

1. Start by simplifying the inequality. To do this, we want to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other side.
2. Subtract 4x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side: $9x - 6 - 4x < 4x + 4 - 4x$ which simplifies to $5x - 6 < 4$.
3. Now, add 6 to both sides to get the constant on the other side: $5x - 6 + 6 < 4 + 6$ which simplifies to $5x < 10$.
4. Finally, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: $5x/5 < 10/5$ which simplifies to $x < 2$.

First, this is a free text response question.

Second, the thought process for this question involves identifying the pattern in the given sequence of fractions. We can observe that the numerator of each fraction is one less than the denominator. The sequence starts at $\frac{1}{2}$ and the numerator and denominator both increase by 1 in each subsequent term. 

So, starting with $\frac{1}{2}$, the next term is $\frac{2}{3}$ (numerator and denominator each increased by 1), then $\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{4}{5}$, and $\frac{5}{6}$. Following this pattern, the next term should have a numerator that is one less than its denominator, and both should be one more than the previous term's numerator and denominator.

Third, the answer is:
The next term in the sequence is $\frac{6}{7}$, as we increase both the numerator and denominator of the last term, $\frac{5}{6}$, by 1.

\section{M042235}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve the system of equations, we can use either substitution or elimination. Here, I will use the elimination method.

Step 1: Align the equations:
1. $x + y = 12$
2. $2x + 5y = 36$

Step 2: Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of x with the second equation:
$2(x + y) = 2(12)$
$2x + 2y = 24$

Now we have:
1. $2x + 2y = 24$
2. $2x + 5y = 36$

Step 3: Subtract the first new equation from the second original equation to eliminate x:
$(2x + 5y) - (2x + 2y) = 36 - 24$
$5y - 2y = 36 - 24$
$3y = 12$

Step 4: Solve for y:
$y = \frac{12}{3}$
$y = 4$

Step 5: Substitute the value of y into the first original equation to solve for x:
$x + 4 = 12$
$x = 12 - 4$
$x = 8$

Step 6: Check the solution with the second original equation:
$2x + 5y = 36$
$2(8) + 5(4) = 36$
$16 + 20 = 36$
$36 = 36$ (which is true, so the solution is correct)

\section{M042245}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this question, we need to check each equation with the given pairs of numbers to see which one is satisfied by both.

Let's start with option [A] $x+y=-1$:
For the pair $(0,-1)$, we have $0+(-1)=-1$, which is true.
For the pair $(1,3)$, we have $1+3=4$, which is not equal to $-1$. So, option [A] is not satisfied by both pairs.

Now, let's check option [B] $2x+y=5$:
For the pair $(0,-1)$, we have $2(0)+(-1)=-1$, which is not equal to $5$.
For the pair $(1,3)$, we have $2(1)+3=5$, which is true. But since it's not true for the first pair, option [B] is not the correct answer.

Next, let's check option [C] $3x-y=0$:
For the pair $(0,-1)$, we have $3(0)-(-1)=1$, which is not equal to $0$.
For the pair $(1,3)$, we have $3(1)-3=0$, which is true. But since it's not true for the first pair, option [C] is not the correct answer.

Finally, let's check option [D] $4x-y=1$:
For the pair $(0,-1)$, we have $4(0)-(-1)=1$, which is true.
For the pair $(1,3)$, we have $4(1)-3=1$, which is also true. So, option [D] is satisfied by both pairs.

\section{M052002}
First, type of question: This is a free text response question.

Second, the thought process and reasoning: 
To find the length of the longest piece, we first need to find the value of x. Since we know the total length of the wood is 40 cm and it is cut into three pieces, we can write an equation to represent the sum of the lengths of the three pieces:

\(2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40\)

Combining like terms gives us:

\(4x + 8 = 40\)

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

\(4x = 32\)

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:

\(x = 8\)

Now we substitute x back into the expressions for the lengths of each piece to find the actual lengths:

The first piece is \(2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11\) cm.

The second piece is \(x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15\) cm.

The third piece is \(x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14\) cm.

Comparing the lengths of the three pieces, we see that the longest piece is the second piece, which is 15 cm long.

Third, answer: [The length of the longest piece is 15 cm].

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, we need to calculate the total area of the garden and subtract the area of the path.

Step 1: Calculate the total area of the garden.
The total dimensions of the garden are \(x\) meters by \((x + 4)\) meters. Therefore, the total area is:
\[ \text{Total area} = x \times (x + 4) = x^2 + 4x \]

Step 2: Calculate the area of the path.
The path is 1 meter wide and runs along the length of the garden, which is \(x\) meters. Therefore, the area of the path is:
\[ \text{Path area} = 1 \times x = x \]

Step 3: Subtract the area of the path from the total area to find the area of the shaded portion.
\[ \text{Shaded area} = \text{Total area} - \text{Path area} = (x^2 + 4x) - x \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 4x - x \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 3x \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the hole in terms of the number of cubes that would fit into it. From the image, we can see that the hole extends through the shape. We need to count the number of cubes that would fit along the length, width, and depth of the hole.

Looking at the length (from left to right in the image), it appears that the hole spans 3 cubes. For the width (from front to back in the image), the hole also spans 3 cubes. Since the hole goes all the way through, the depth would be the same as the height of the cubes on either side of the hole, which is 2 cubes.

To find the perimeter of the square, we first need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of the side by taking the square root of the area.

The area of the square is given as \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \). Taking the square root of 144 gives us \( \sqrt{144} = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \). This is the length of one side of the square.

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side} \). Since we found that one side is \( 12 \mathrm{~cm} \), the perimeter is \( 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).

Thought process and reasoning:
- First, we need to calculate the total time from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.
- From 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. is 40 minutes, and from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. is another 60 minutes.
- So, the total time is 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes.
- We know that the minute hand of a clock turns through 360 degrees in 60 minutes (a full hour).
- To find out how many degrees the minute hand turns through in 100 minutes, we can set up a proportion or simply calculate the degrees per minute and multiply by the total minutes.
- Degrees per minute is 360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute.

\section{M032398}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of angles in triangles. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^{\circ} \).

First, let's find the angle at the top of the larger triangle. We can see that it is part of a smaller triangle with angles of \( 65^{\circ} \) and \( x \). The sum of angles in this smaller triangle must also be \( 180^{\circ} \), so the third angle is \( 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x \).

Now, looking at the larger triangle, we have a \( 45^{\circ} \) angle, a \( 30^{\circ} \) angle, and the angle we just found, which is \( 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x \). The sum of these three angles must equal \( 180^{\circ} \) because they are the angles of the larger triangle.

So, we have:

\[ 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + (180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x) = 180^{\circ} \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 75^{\circ} + 115^{\circ} - x = 180^{\circ} \]

\[ 190^{\circ} - x = 180^{\circ} \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 190^{\circ} - 180^{\circ} \]

\[ x = 10^{\circ} \]

However, none of the options given match \( 10^{\circ} \), which suggests there might be a mistake in my calculations or in the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

1. Calculate the top angle of the larger triangle: \( 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} = 115^{\circ} \).
2. Sum of angles in the larger triangle: \( 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + 115^{\circ} = 190^{\circ} \), which is incorrect because the sum should be \( 180^{\circ} \).

There is an error in the previous calculation. The correct calculation for the top angle of the larger triangle should be:

\[ 180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - x = 115^{\circ} - x \]

Now, let's sum up the angles in the larger triangle correctly:

\[ 45^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} + (115^{\circ} - x) = 180^{\circ} \]

\[ 75^{\circ} + 115^{\circ} - x = 180^{\circ} \]

\[ 190^{\circ} - x = 180^{\circ} \]

\[ x = 190^{\circ} - 180^{\circ} \]

\[ x = 10^{\circ} \]

The calculation still results in \( x = 10^{\circ} \), which is not among the options provided. Since this is a multiple-choice question, there might be an error in the question itself or the provided options. However, based on the calculations and the information given, the correct answer should be \( x = 10^{\circ} \). If I have to choose from the options provided, I would have to make an educated guess, but none of the options match the calculated value.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine whether triangle PQR is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's evaluate the options:

[A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

This option is stating that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (3 cm and 4 cm) is equal to the square of the longest side (5 cm). Let's check the math:

$3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$
$5^2 = 25$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, this supports the idea that triangle PQR is a right triangle according to the Pythagorean theorem.

[B] $5 < 3 + 4$

This option is stating that the length of the longest side (5 cm) is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. This is a requirement for any triangle to exist (the Triangle Inequality Theorem), not specifically a right triangle.

[C] $3 + 4 = 12 - 5$

This option is simply an arithmetic statement that is true (7 = 7) but does not provide any geometric information about the triangle being a right triangle.

[D] $3 > 5 - 4$

This option is stating that one side (3 cm) is greater than the difference between the lengths of the hypotenuse (5 cm) and another side (4 cm). This is not relevant to determining whether the triangle is a right triangle.

The correct answer is the one that aligns with the Pythagorean theorem:

Answer: [A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

\section{M032623}
First, type of question: This is a multiple choice question.

Second, think step by step, and describe your thought process and reasoning:

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the white triangle from the area of the entire rectangle.

The area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width:
Area of rectangle = length × width = 16 cm × 6 cm = 96 cm²

The area of the white triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:
Area of triangle = (base × height) / 2

The base of the triangle is 8 cm, and the height is the same as the width of the rectangle, which is 6 cm:
Area of triangle = (8 cm × 6 cm) / 2 = 48 cm² / 2 = 24 cm²

Now, subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to get the area of the shaded region:
Area of shaded region = Area of rectangle - Area of triangle
Area of shaded region = 96 cm² - 24 cm² = 72 cm²

Third, answer:

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the shape of the cutout figure, we need to visualize the folding and cutting process described:

1. The paper is folded in half, which means the cut will be symmetrical along the fold line.
2. The dotted line indicates where the paper will be cut. Since the paper is folded, cutting along the dotted line will produce two identical shapes.
3. The cut starts at one corner of the folded paper and ends 1 cm away from the adjacent side, creating a triangle with two equal sides (each 4 cm long) and one side that is 1 cm long.
4. When the small piece is opened, it will form a symmetrical shape with two identical triangles joined at the 1 cm side, which is the base for each triangle.

The resulting shape is two isosceles triangles that share a common base (the 1 cm side). Therefore, the correct answer is:

[B] two isosceles triangles.

This is a free-text response question.

To find the sum of all the interior angles of a polygon, we can use the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°

where n is the number of sides of the polygon.

For a pentagon, n = 5. Plugging this value into the formula gives us:

Sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 3 × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 540°

Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of pentagon $ABCD E$ is 540 degrees.

To complete the diagram:

1. Start with the square base in the center of the shape. This will remain unchanged as it is the base of the shape.
2. Each triangle flap will be folded up to touch the edge of the adjacent flap. Since we're looking from above, these flaps will not be visible as they will be perpendicular to our line of sight.
3. The resulting shape, when viewed from above, will simply be the square base without any visible flaps.

To solve this, imagine rotating the triangle in the first image 180 degrees (a half-turn) clockwise around point O. This means that the triangle will end up on the opposite side of point O from where it started. Also, since it's a half-turn, the triangle will be flipped over as well.

Looking at the options:
- Option A shows the triangle flipped but not moved to the opposite side of point O.
- Option B shows the triangle moved to the opposite side but not flipped over.
- Option C shows the triangle in the same position, only larger.

\section{M042201}
This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( x \), we will use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

The volume of the box is given as \( 200 \, \text{cm}^3 \), the width is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \), and the height is \( 4 \, \text{cm} \). We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 200 = x \times 5 \times 4 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 5 \times 4 \):

\[ x = \frac{200}{5 \times 4} \]

\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]

\[ x = 10 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).

To draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm on the given grid where each small square represents 1 cm, follow these steps:

1. Select a starting point on the grid for the base of the triangle. Make sure there is enough space above this point to draw the height of the triangle.

2. Count and mark 4 cm (4 squares) horizontally from the starting point to set the length of the base.

3. Find the midpoint of the base by counting 2 cm (2 squares) from either end of the base. This is where the height will intersect the base.

4. From the midpoint, draw a vertical line upwards that is 5 cm (5 squares) long for the height of the triangle.

5. From the top of the height line, draw two lines connecting to the ends of the base to complete the isosceles triangle.

The resulting figure should resemble an isosceles triangle with two equal sides sloping down from the top vertex to the ends of the base, which is 4 cm wide, and a height of 5 cm from the base to the top vertex.

This is a drawing question.

To mark the points B(3,30°) and C(4,120°) on the graph:

1. For point B(3,30°), find the radius line that corresponds to 30°. Then, from the origin O, count outwards along this line until you reach the circle that corresponds to a distance of 3 units from O. Mark this point as B.

2. For point C(4,120°), find the radius line that corresponds to 120°. Then, from the origin O, count outwards along this line until you reach the circle that corresponds to a distance of 4 units from O. Mark this point as C.

To draw the angle BOC and determine its measure:

1. Connect point B to the origin O and point C to the origin O with straight lines to form the angle BOC.

2. To find the measure of angle BOC, observe the difference in the angles from the baseline OA to OB and from OA to OC. Since OB is at 30° and OC is at 120°, the angle BOC is the difference between these two angles.

Calculation: 120° - 30° = 90°.

Therefore, the measure of angle BOC is 90°.

Angle BOC = 90°.

\section{M052084}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of a square, we need to know the length of one of its sides. Since the perimeter of a square is the sum of all four of its sides, we can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by 4.

Step 1: Divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.
\[ \text{Side length} = \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{4} = \frac{36 \mathrm{~cm}}{4} = 9 \mathrm{~cm} \]

Step 2: Calculate the area of the square using the side length.
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Side length} \times \text{Side length} = 9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \]

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

\section{M052206}
This problem involves calculating the volume of the box and the volume of a single book, and then determining how many books can fit into the box based on these volumes. However, since the books have specific dimensions, we need to consider how they can be oriented to fit into the box in the most efficient manner.

First, let's calculate the volume of the box:
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 36 \, \text{cm} \times 30 \, \text{cm} \times 20 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of the box} = 21600 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, we calculate the volume of a single book:
\[ \text{Volume of a book} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 20 \, \text{cm} \times 15 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ \text{Volume of a book} = 1800 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

To maximize the number of books in the box, we should arrange the books so that their dimensions align with the dimensions of the box as closely as possible. Looking at the dimensions, it seems that the books could be oriented with the 15 cm side along the 30 cm side of the box and the 20 cm side along the 36 cm side of the box. This would mean that the books are standing on their 6 cm side.

Let's see how many books fit along each dimension of the box:
- Along the 36 cm side: \( \frac{36 \, \text{cm}}{20 \, \text{cm/book}} = 1.8 \) books, which means we can fit 1 book along this side.
- Along the 30 cm side: \( \frac{30 \, \text{cm}}{15 \, \text{cm/book}} = 2 \) books, which means we can fit 2 books along this side.
- Along the 20 cm height: \( \frac{20 \, \text{cm}}{6 \, \text{cm/book}} = 3.\overline{3} \) books, which means we can fit 3 books along the height.

Therefore, the maximum number of books that can fit into the box is:
\[ 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

The largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 6.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052362}
This question is a free-text response type.

Step 1: Identify the type of triangle.
The information given indicates that AC = BC, which means triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with the two legs (AC and BC) being equal.

Step 2: Analyze the relationship between AB and CX.
AB is twice as long as CX. Since CX is perpendicular to AB and bisects it (as it is a property of isosceles triangles that the altitude to the base is also the median), this means that AX = XB = 2 * CX.

Step 3: Calculate the angles.
Since AC = BC and AX = XB, triangles ACX and BCX are congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) postulate (AC = BC, angle ACX = angle BCX = 90 degrees, and AX = XB).

Because the triangles are congruent, all corresponding angles are equal. Thus, angle ACB (which is the same as angle BCA) is bisected by line segment CX.

Step 4: Find the measure of angle B.
In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Therefore, angle ACB is equal to angle BAC.

Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, and we have two angles at C (each being one half of angle ACB since CX bisects it), let's denote each of these angles as θ. Therefore, angle ACB is 2θ.

The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is:
angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees
θ + angle ABC + 2θ = 180 degrees
angle ABC + 3θ = 180 degrees

Because ACX and BCX are congruent triangles, angle ACX (θ) is the same as angle BCX (θ), and angle ABC is also θ.

Thus, we have:
angle ABC + 3θ = 180 degrees
θ + 3θ = 180 degrees
4θ = 180 degrees
θ = 180 degrees / 4
θ = 45 degrees

So, angle ABC (which is the same as θ) is 45 degrees.

Answer: [45 degrees].

To find the value of $b$, we can use the fact that lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel and the given angles are formed by a transversal line. The angle labeled 70 degrees and the angle we are trying to find, labeled $b$, are alternate interior angles. Alternate interior angles are equal when the lines are parallel, which means that the measure of angle $b$ is equal to the measure of the given 70-degree angle.

Therefore, the value of $b$ is 70 degrees.

\section{M032507}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector and then apply that probability to the total number of spins.

First, we count the number of sectors on the spinner. There are 5 sectors in total: Orange, Green, Blue, Red, and Purple.

Since the spinner appears to be divided into equal parts, each sector has an equal chance of being landed on. Therefore, the probability of landing on any one sector, including the red sector, is 1 out of 5, or 1/5.

Now, we apply this probability to the total number of spins:

Number of expected red sector landings = Total spins * Probability of landing on red
= 600 * (1/5)
= 600/5
= 120

However, none of the provided options ([A] 30, [B] 40, [C] 50, [D] 60) match the calculated expectation of 120. There might be an error in the options provided or in the interpretation of the image. Based on the calculations, the expected number of times the spinner should land on the red sector out of 600 spins is 120, which is not listed in the options. If I have to choose from the given options, I would have to make an educated guess, which is not appropriate in this case since the correct answer is not listed.

\section{M032681A}
To determine by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, as it represents the actual car production by the NU Car Motor Company.

Starting from the y-axis (Total Number of Cars Produced), we need to find the point where the value is 150. From there, we draw a horizontal line to the right until it intersects with the solid line that represents the car production. At the point of intersection, we then draw a vertical line down to the x-axis (Time) to determine the time.

Looking at the graph, the horizontal line from the 150 mark on the y-axis intersects the solid line between 11 AM and 12 noon. The exact time seems to be just a bit before 12 noon, but it's not possible to give a precise minute count with the resolution provided in the image.

Therefore, by approximately just before 12 noon, a total of 150 cars had been produced.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
To find the average number of cars produced per hour on this day by the NU Car Motor Company, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, which represents the actual car production.

First, we need to determine the total number of cars produced by the end of the day. At 4 pm, the graph shows that the total number of cars produced is just under 400. For the purposes of this calculation, I will assume it is 400 cars exactly.

Next, we need to calculate the time span of the production. According to the graph, production started at 8 am and ended at 4 pm, which is a total of 8 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average number of cars produced per hour by dividing the total number of cars produced by the number of hours:

Average cars produced per hour = Total number of cars produced / Total number of hours
Average cars produced per hour = 400 cars / 8 hours
Average cars produced per hour = 50 cars per hour

So, the average number of cars produced per hour on this day was 50 cars per hour.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681C}
The graph shows the total number of cars produced over time, with the solid line representing the actual car production and the dotted line representing what the production would be if it were constant throughout the day.

To determine during which hour the most cars were produced, we need to look for the hour where the solid line has the steepest slope, because the steepest part of the curve indicates the greatest increase in total production over the shortest period of time.

Looking at the graph, the solid line shows the most significant increase between 1 pm and 2 pm. This is where the line rises most sharply compared to other hours, indicating the highest production rate during that hour.

Therefore, the most cars were produced between 1 pm and 2 pm.

To create a pie chart, we need to calculate the percentage of the whole for each category and then convert these percentages to angles, because a circle is 360 degrees. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Determine the remainder of students planning to enter the workforce:
   Total students = 400
   Planning to go to university = 50
   Planning to go to a polytechnic school = 100
   Planning to go to a business college = 150
   Planning to enter the workforce = 400 - (50 + 100 + 150) = 100 students

2. Calculate the percentage for each category:
   University: (50 / 400) * 100% = 12.5%
   Polytechnic: (100 / 400) * 100% = 25%
   Business college: (150 / 400) * 100% = 37.5%
   Workforce: (100 / 400) * 100% = 25%

3. Convert percentages to angles:
   University: 360 * (12.5 / 100) = 45 degrees
   Polytechnic: 360 * (25 / 100) = 90 degrees
   Business college: 360 * (37.5 / 100) = 135 degrees
   Workforce: 360 * (25 / 100) = 90 degrees

4. Draw the pie chart:
   - Start from the top of the circle and measure out the angle for each category using a protractor.
   - Label each section with the corresponding category:
     - The 45-degree section labeled "University"
     - The 90-degree section labeled "Polytechnic"
     - The 135-degree section labeled "Business College"
     - The remaining 90-degree section labeled "Workforce"

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the year in which the sales of Cherry Cola will be the same as the sales of Lemon Cola, we need to analyze the trends shown in the graph and estimate when the two lines representing the sales of each drink would intersect if extended.

From the graph, we can see that the sales of Lemon Cola are consistently decreasing each year, while the sales of Cherry Cola are consistently increasing. The sales of Lemon Cola decrease by approximately the same amount each year, and the sales of Cherry Cola increase by approximately the same amount each year.

To estimate when the sales will be equal, we can look at the difference in sales between the two drinks in the last year shown, 2001. The sales of Lemon Cola are just over 50 million cans, and the sales of Cherry Cola are just under 30 million cans, giving us a difference of just over 20 million cans.

Given that the trends continue at a steady rate, we can estimate that the sales of Cherry Cola are increasing and the sales of Lemon Cola are decreasing by about 5 million cans per year (this is a rough estimate based on the visible trends in the graph). If this trend continues, it would take approximately 4 years for the sales of Cherry Cola to equal the sales of Lemon Cola (since 20 million cans divided by the 5 million cans change per year equals 4 years).

The last year shown on the graph is 2001, so adding 4 years to 2001 gives us 2005 as the estimated year when the sales of Cherry Cola will be the same as the sales of Lemon Cola.

[C] 2005

This is a free-text response question.

To find the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up the total number of staff members across all restaurants.
2. Divide the total number of staff by the number of restaurants.

Let's do the calculation:

Step 1: Add up the number of staff members.
$12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30 = 100$

Step 2: Divide the total number of staff by the number of restaurants.
$100 \div 5 = 20$

The mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is 20.

[provide your short answer]: 20
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042169B}
First, this is a free-text response question.

To find the median, we need to arrange the numbers in ascending order and then find the middle value. 

The numbers given are already in ascending order: $12, 18, 19, 21, 30$.

Since there are 5 numbers, the median will be the third number (as it is the middle one with two numbers on either side).

The third number in the list is $19$.

Therefore, the median number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is [19].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042169C}
First, this is a free-text response question.

To solve this, we need to understand what the median and mean are:
- The median is the middle value of a list of numbers when they're arranged in ascending or descending order.
- The mean is the average of all the numbers.

The current list of staff members is: 12, 18, 19, 21, 30.

Step 1: Find the current median.
The middle value, when the numbers are in order, is 19. So, the current median is 19.

Step 2: Find the current mean.
To find the mean, we add all the numbers together and divide by the number of values.
Mean = (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20.

Step 3: Analyze the effect on the median if the restaurant with 30 staff increases to 50.
The new list of staff members will be: 12, 18, 19, 21, 50.
The median would still be 19, as it is the middle number, and increasing the last value does not change the order of the middle value.

Step 4: Analyze the effect on the mean if the restaurant with 30 staff increases to 50.
The new total number of staff members will be: 12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50 = 120.
The new mean will be 120 / 5 = 24.

So, increasing the staff members from 30 to 50 will not change the median, but it will increase the mean from 20 to 24.

[Median remains the same, the mean increases]

To find out how many bottles of the regular size the shopkeeper should order, we need to calculate 50% of the total order of 1,200 bottles.

Step 1: Convert the percentage to a decimal to make the calculation easier. 50% is the same as 0.5 when expressed as a decimal.

Step 2: Multiply the total number of bottles by the decimal. So, we calculate 0.5 * 1,200.

Step 3: Perform the multiplication to get the number of regular size bottles. 

Answer:

Step by step reasoning:
1. First, we need to determine the total number of buttons in the bag. This is the sum of the red, blue, and white buttons: 10 (red) + 8 (blue) + 4 (white) = 22 buttons in total.
2. Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes for our event, which is drawing either a blue button or a white button. There are 8 blue buttons and 4 white buttons, so the number of favorable outcomes is 8 (blue) + 4 (white) = 12 buttons.
3. The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of drawing a blue or white button is 12 (favorable outcomes) / 22 (total outcomes).
4. Simplify the fraction if possible. However, in this case, 12/22 cannot be simplified further.

To complete and label the given pie chart with the information provided in the table, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students surveyed. According to the table, the total is 480 students.
2. Determine the percentage of students who favor each sport. This is done by dividing the number of students who favor each sport by the total number of students and then multiplying by 100.
   - Hockey: (60 / 480) * 100 = 12.5%
   - Football: (180 / 480) * 100 = 37.5%
   - Tennis: (120 / 480) * 100 = 25%
   - Basketball: (120 / 480) * 100 = 25%
3. Calculate the angle for each sport's slice of the pie chart. Since a full circle is 360 degrees, multiply each percentage by 360/100 to find the angle.
   - Hockey: 12.5% of 360° = 45°
   - Football: 37.5% of 360° = 135°
   - Tennis: 25% of 360° = 90°
   - Basketball: 25% of 360° = 90°
4. Draw the pie chart using the calculated angles for each sport. Start from the top (12 o'clock position) and measure out the angle for each sport clockwise.
   - Place the first slice for Hockey with a 45° angle.
   - Next, measure out 135° for Football starting from where the Hockey slice ends.
   - Then, measure out 90° for Tennis starting from where the Football slice ends.
   - Finally, measure out 90° for Basketball starting from where the Tennis slice ends. The last slice should end where the first Hockey slice started.
5. Label each slice with the name of the sport and the percentage or number of students.

When drawing the pie chart, make sure that the slices add up to a full circle and that the proportions are as accurate as possible. Use a protractor to measure the angles if you're doing this by hand. If you're using software, input the angles or percentages directly to create the chart.

Type of question: Multiple choice

Thought process and reasoning:
- The results show that Pat received 80% of the votes, while Chris received 20%.
- If a student is chosen at random, the probability that they voted for Pat is 80%.
- A probability of 80% is quite high, so it is more likely than not that the student voted for Pat.
- However, it is not certain (100%) that the student voted for Pat, as there is still a 20% chance they voted for Chris.

Answer:
[B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.

\section{M042269}
Type of question: Multiple choice

Thought process and reasoning:
- Option [A] suggests that every individual in team B outperformed every individual in team A. This cannot be concluded solely based on the average lengths.
- Option [B] implies a one-to-one comparison after each jump, which also cannot be determined from the average lengths alone.
- Option [C] states that as a group, team B jumped farther than team A. This is a reasonable conclusion because the average jump length of team B is higher than that of team A, and since there were the same number of students in each team, the total distance covered by team B would be greater than that of team A.
- Option [D] suggests that some individuals in team A could have jumped farther than some individuals in team B. This is possible even with a lower average, as averages do not preclude individual variations within the teams.

Answer:
[C] As a group, team B jumped farther than team A.

\section{M052429}
Type of question: Multiple choice

Thought process and reasoning:
Since Sue puts the red marble back into the bag, the total number of marbles in the bag remains the same, as does the number of red marbles. There are still 10 marbles in the bag, with 5 of them being red. The probability of drawing a red marble is therefore the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles.

Calculation:
The probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles (5) divided by the total number of marbles (10), which is:
\[ \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Answer: [A] $\frac{1}{2}$

The age structure of a country can have a significant impact on its population growth. In the graphs provided, we can see the population distribution of Country X and Country Y across three age groups:

- Ages 0–19 (Going to have children)
- Ages 20–44 (Having children)
- Ages 45–89 (Finished having children)

Country X has a larger base in the youngest age group (0–19), indicating a higher number of individuals who are soon going to enter the reproductive age group (20–44). As these individuals reach reproductive age, they will potentially have children, contributing to the population growth.

On the other hand, Country Y has a narrower base for the youngest age group and a more uniform distribution across the age groups, with a smaller proportion of the population in the 0–19 age group compared to Country X. This suggests that there will be fewer individuals entering the reproductive age group in the near future, leading to a slower rate of population growth.

In summary, the age structure of Country X, with a larger proportion of young people who will enter reproductive age, could lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y, which has fewer young people and a more evenly distributed population across age groups.

\section{M052503B}
The image shows two population pyramids comparing the age structure between Country X and Country Y. Population pyramids are graphical illustrations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population, which typically forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for the following reasons:

1. The shape of Country Y's pyramid indicates slow growth, with a larger proportion of the population in the older age groups (45-89 years), as shown by the broad top of the pyramid.

2. The base of Country Y's pyramid, representing the youngest age group (0-19 years), is narrower compared to the middle section (20-44 years), suggesting that there are relatively fewer young people entering the workforce. This demographic trend implies that there will be a smaller working-age population to support the elderly.

3. In contrast, Country X has a broad base, indicating a large young population that will enter the workforce in the future, providing a larger base of workers to support the elderly.

4. The implications of these trends suggest that Country Y will face a higher dependency ratio, meaning fewer workers will be available to support a growing elderly population, potentially leading to increased economic and social challenges related to healthcare, pensions, and social services.

This is a free-text response question.

To figure out the value of \( x \) in the pattern, let's look for a consistent relationship between the numbers in the pattern. By examining the numbers, it appears that each number in the bottom row is the sum of the two numbers immediately above it in the pattern. For example:

- \( 16 \) is the sum of \( 6 \) and \( 10 \).
- \( 40 \) is the sum of \( 14 \) and some number \( x \).

So, if we use this pattern to find \( x \), we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 14 = 40 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 40 - 14 \]
\[ x = 26 \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) in this pattern is 26.
