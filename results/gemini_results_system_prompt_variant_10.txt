- for $6 \times 6$ shape: 20 black tiles and 32 red tiles
- for $7 \times 7$ shape: 28 black tiles and 48 red tiles
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760A}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.

2. Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the relationship between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. From the table, we can see that the number of black tiles is 1, 4, 9, ..., and the number of red tiles is 8, 12, 16, .... The difference between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles is 7, 8, 9, .... So we can guess that the number of black tiles is 7 less than the number of red tiles.

3. Now we need to find out the total number of tiles. From the table, we can see that the total number of tiles is 9, 16, 25, .... The difference between the total number of tiles and the number of black tiles is 8, 12, 16, .... So we can guess that the total number of tiles is 8 more than the number of black tiles.

4. Finally, we can use the relationship between the number of black tiles, the number of red tiles, and the total number of tiles to find out the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles when the total number of tiles is 64. Let's assume that the number of black tiles is x. Then the number of red tiles is x + 7. And the total number of tiles is x + (x + 7) + 8 = 2x + 15. So we can get the equation: 2x + 15 = 64. By solving the equation, we can get x = 24. Therefore, the number of black tiles is 24 and the number of red tiles is 24 + 7 = 31.

5. The answer is: 24 black tiles and 31 red tiles.

\section{M032761}
 1. The question type is free-text response.

2. Let's think step-by-step.
- First, we need to find the pattern for the number of black tiles. 
 - We can see that the number of black tiles is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. 
 - The differences between these numbers are 3, 5, 7, 9. 
 - The differences between the differences are 2, 2, 2. 
 - So the pattern for the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$.
- Second, we need to find the pattern for the number of red tiles. 
 - We can see that the number of red tiles is 8, 12, 16, 20, 24. 
 - The differences between these numbers are 4, 4, 4, 4. 
 - So the pattern for the number of red tiles is 4n.
- Finally, we can find the total number of tiles by adding the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. 
 - So the pattern for the total number of tiles is $(n-2)^2 + 4n$.

3. The answer is $(n-2)^2 + 4n$.

\section{M052002}
1. type of question: free text response
2. Let's think step by step.
The total length of the three pieces must be equal to the original length of the wood, which is 40 cm.
Therefore, we can write an equation:

$$(2x-5) + (x+7) + (x+6) = 40$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$4x + 8 = 40$$

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

$$4x = 32$$

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

$$x = 8$$

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the length of the longest piece, which is given by the expression $2x-5$.

Substituting x = 8 into the expression, we get:

$$2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11$$

Therefore, the length of the longest piece is 11 cm.

\section{M032116}
1. Type of question: multiple choice.
2. Thought process:
- The area of a square is given by $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of one side of the square.
- So, $s = \sqrt{A} = \sqrt{144} = 12$.
- The perimeter of a square is given by $P = 4s$, where $s$ is the length of one side of the square.

\section{M032324}
1. type of question: multiple choice;
2. thought process: 
- The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts. 
- The distance between two points is the length of the line segment connecting them. 
- To find the distance between the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$, we need to first find the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$. 
- The midpoint of $AB$ is the point that is $5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from $A$ and $5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from $B$. 
- The midpoint of $BC$ is the point that is $2.6 \mathrm{~cm}$ from $B$ and $2.6 \mathrm{~cm}$ from $C$. 
- The distance between the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$ is the length of the line segment connecting these two points. 
- We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of this line segment. 
- The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. 
- In this case, the hypotenuse is the line segment connecting the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$, and the other two sides are the line segments connecting the midpoint of $AB$ to the midpoint of $BC$ and the midpoint of $BC$ to the midpoint of $AB$. 
- The length of the line segment connecting the midpoint of $AB$ to the midpoint of $BC$ is $5 \mathrm{~cm}$, and the length of the line segment connecting the midpoint of $BC$ to the midpoint of $AB$ is $2.6 \mathrm{~cm}$. 
- So, the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{5^2 + 2.6^2} = 5.83 \mathrm{~cm}$. 
- Therefore, the distance between the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$ is $5.83 \mathrm{~cm}$.

\section{M032398}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.

2. We can see that the angle on the left is 45 degrees, and the angle on the right is 30 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we know that the angle at the top must be 105 degrees. The angle bisectors of a triangle divide the angles in half, so we know that the angle x must be 52.5 degrees.

3. The answer is [C] 45 degrees.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032402}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the triangle is a right angle triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is 5 cm, and the other two sides are 3 cm and 4 cm. If the Pythagorean theorem is true, then the triangle is a right angle triangle.
3. Let's calculate the squares of the three sides:
- Hypotenuse: $5^2 = 25$
- Side $PQ: 3^2 = 9$
- Side $QR: 4^2 = 16$
4. Now, let's check if the Pythagorean theorem is true:
- $25 = 9 + 16$
- $25 = 25$
5. Since the Pythagorean theorem is true, the triangle is a right angle triangle.
6. Therefore, the answer is [A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032623}
 1. This is a multiple-choice question.
2. The area of a triangle is 1/2 (base x height). The base of the triangle is 8 cm, and the height is 6 cm. So the area of the triangle is 1/2 x 8 cm x 6 cm = 24 cm^2. The area of the rectangle is 16 cm x 6 cm = 96 cm^2. So the area of the shaded region is 96 cm^2 - 24 cm^2 = 72 cm^2.
3. [D]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032679}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. First, we need to understand what the question is asking. We are given a piece of paper in the shape of a rectangle, and we are asked to fold it in half and then cut it along the dotted line. The question is asking us to identify the shape of the cutout figure.
3. To answer this question, we need to think step by step. First, we need to fold the paper in half. This will create a crease in the paper. Then, we need to cut the paper along the dotted line. This will create two pieces of paper. One piece will be the original rectangle, and the other piece will be the cutout figure.
4. Now, we need to identify the shape of the cutout figure. The cutout figure is a triangle. To determine the type of triangle, we need to look at the sides of the triangle. All three sides of the triangle are the same length. Therefore, the cutout figure is an equilateral triangle.
5. Therefore, the answer to the question is [D].

\section{M042201}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.
2. The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula:
$$V = lwh$$
where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
In this question, we are given the volume of the box (200 cm^3) and the height of the box (4 cm). We need to find the length of the box (x).
To find the length of the box, we can rearrange the formula for the volume of a rectangular box as follows:
$$l = \frac{V}{wh}$$
Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:
$$l = \frac{200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}{(4 \mathrm{~cm})(5 \mathrm{~cm})}$$
$$l = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$$
Therefore, the value of x is 10 cm.
3. The answer is [D].

\section{M042270}
 1. The question is a drawing question.


2. First, draw the base of the triangle. The base is 4 cm long, so we need to draw a line 4 cm long. We can start at any point on the grid, but let's start at the bottom left corner. We draw a line 4 cm to the right.


3. Next, we need to draw the height of the triangle. The height is 5 cm long, so we need to draw a line 5 cm long. We can start at any point on the base of the triangle, but let's start at the left endpoint. We draw a line 5 cm up.


4. Finally, we need to connect the endpoints of the base to the endpoint of the height. We draw two lines, each 5 cm long.

\section{M042300Z}
 1. To mark the point $B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)$, we first find the point on the graph that is 3 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin through this point, making an angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the baseline. The point where this line intersects the circle is the point $B$.

To mark the point $C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)$, we first find the point on the graph that is 4 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin through this point, making an angle of $120^{\circ}$ with the baseline. The point where this line intersects the circle is the point $C$.


2. To draw the angle $B O C$, we first draw a line from the point $B$ to the origin. We then draw a line from the origin to the point $C$. The angle between these two lines is the angle $B O C$.

To measure the angle $B O C$, we can use a protractor. We place the protractor at the origin, with the zero-degree mark aligned with the line $O B$. We then read the angle of the line $O C$ on the protractor. The angle $B O C$ is $90^{\circ}$.

Therefore, the answer is: $90^{\circ}$

\section{M052084}
1. type of question: multiple choice;
2. thought process and reasoning:
- The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.
- Since the perimeter of the square is $36 \mathrm{~cm}$, each side of the square is $36 \mathrm{~cm} / 4 = 9 \mathrm{~cm}$.
- The area of a square is the square of the length of one side.
- Therefore, the area of the square is $9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.

\section{M052503A}
 1. The question type is multiple choice.
2. The graphs show the age structure of each country's population. The population is divided into three age groups from youngest to oldest. The graphs enable predictions about population growth.
The age structure of Country X is more likely to lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y because there is a larger proportion of the population in the 0–19 age group in Country X. This means that there will be a larger number of people reaching childbearing age in the future, which will lead to a larger number of births. In addition, there is a smaller proportion of the population in the 65+ age group, which means that there will be fewer people retiring and fewer people drawing on social security. This will free up more resources for the government to invest in education and healthcare, which will lead to a more productive and healthy population.
3. The answer is A.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M052503A}
 1. The question type is multiple choice.
2. First, I need to identify the key information from the graphs. The graphs show the age structure of the population in Country X and Country Y. The population is divided into three age groups: 0-19, 20-44, and 45-89. The graphs show that Country X has a larger percentage of its population in the 0-19 age group than Country Y. Country Y has a larger percentage of its population in the 45-89 age group than Country X.
3. Based on this information, I can infer that Country Y will have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X. This is because Country Y has a smaller percentage of its population in the 20-44 age group, which is the age group that is typically responsible for taking care of the elderly.
4. Therefore, I would select the answer choice that states that Country Y will have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X.
