To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jenny gets and then subtract that amount from the total to find out how much Ann gets.

1. Since Jenny gets $\frac{3}{8}$ of the $560$ zeds, we need to calculate $\frac{3}{8}$ of $560$.
2. To do this, we multiply $560$ by $\frac{3}{8}$.
3. This can be calculated as:
   \[\frac{3}{8} \times 560 = 3 \times \frac{560}{8}\]
4. Simplify the fraction by dividing $560$ by $8$.
5. $560$ divided by $8$ equals $70$.
6. Now multiply $70$ by $3$ to get the amount Jenny receives.
7. $70 \times 3 = 210$.
8. Jenny gets $210$ zeds.
9. To find out how many zeds Ann gets, we subtract Jenny's amount from the total.
10. $560 - 210 = 350$.

Answer: Ann will get [350 zeds].

To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions together. Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before we can add them. The common denominator for 100 and 1000 is 1000 because 1000 is a multiple of 100.

First, we convert the fraction with the smaller denominator to have the same denominator as the larger one. We do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the first fraction by 10, since 1000 is 10 times 100.

So, $\frac{4}{100}$ becomes $\frac{4 \times 10}{100 \times 10} = \frac{40}{1000}$.

Now we can add the two fractions:

$\frac{40}{1000} + \frac{3}{1000} = \frac{40 + 3}{1000} = \frac{43}{1000}$.

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

$43 \div 1000 = 0.043$.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: [A] 0.043

To estimate the value of $\frac{7.21 \times 3.86}{10.09}$, we can round each number to its nearest whole number and then perform the calculation.

Step by step:

1. Round 7.21 to 7 (since it's closer to 7 than to 8).
2. Round 3.86 to 4 (since it's closer to 4 than to 3).
3. Round 10.09 to 10 (since it's closer to 10 than to 11).

Now, we can substitute these rounded numbers into the original expression:

$\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$

This gives us an estimated result of $\frac{28}{10}$, which simplifies to 2.8.

Looking at the options, option [B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$ matches our estimation.

Answer: [B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. 

Step 1: We start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing until we cannot divide by 2 anymore.

Step 2: We then move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3, and continue this process with increasing prime numbers until we are left with only prime numbers.

Let's apply this to the number 36:

1. 36 is divisible by 2: $36 ÷ 2 = 18$
2. 18 is also divisible by 2: $18 ÷ 2 = 9$
3. 9 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3: $9 ÷ 3 = 3$
4. Finally, 3 is a prime number, so we are left with $3 ÷ 3 = 1$

Putting it all together, we have the prime factors of 36 as $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

\section{M032662}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of multiplying fractions. When two fractions that are both less than 1 are multiplied together, the result is smaller than either of the original fractions. This is because a fraction represents a part of a whole, and when you take a part of a part, you end up with a smaller piece.

Looking at the number line in the first image, we see that both P and Q are between 0 and 1, which means they are both fractions less than 1. Therefore, their product, N, must be less than either P or Q.

Now, let's look at the options provided in the second image:

A. Shows N to the right of 1, which would mean N is greater than 1. This cannot be correct because the product of two fractions less than 1 cannot be greater than 1.

B. Shows N between Q and 1. This suggests that N is greater than Q, which is not possible because the product of two fractions less than 1 must be less than either fraction.

C. Shows N between P and Q. This would imply that N is greater than P but less than Q. Since we cannot determine the exact values of P and Q, we cannot conclude that N must be between P and Q.

D. Shows N to the left of P. This is the only position where N is less than both P and Q, which aligns with the rule that the product of two fractions less than 1 is less than either fraction.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: [D].

To convert $3 \frac{5}{6}$ to decimal form, we first need to convert the fractional part $\frac{5}{6}$ to a decimal. 

Step 1: Divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator. 
So, we divide 5 by 6 which gives us 0.8333...

Step 2: Since we need to round to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal place. If it is 5 or more, we round the second decimal place up. In this case, the third decimal place is 3, which is less than 5, so we do not round up.

Step 3: Combine the whole number part with the decimal part. 
The whole number part is 3, and the decimal part is 0.83 (after rounding to two decimal places).

To solve this problem, we can use the table provided to find the powers of 4 that correspond to the numbers 256 and 4,096. 

Looking at the table, we see that:
- $256$ corresponds to $4^4$
- $4,096$ corresponds to $4^6$

To multiply these two numbers, we can use the property of exponents which states that when multiplying two powers with the same base, we can add the exponents. 

So, $256 \times 4,096$ is equivalent to $4^4 \times 4^6$. 

Using the property of exponents, we add the exponents:

$4^4 \times 4^6 = 4^{4+6} = 4^{10}$

To determine the value of $K$ on the number line, we need to look at the intervals between the whole numbers and see where $K$ falls.

1. The number line shows the whole numbers 26 and 28, with 27 in between. The marks between 27 and 28 represent tenths, as there are ten equal segments between any two consecutive whole numbers.

2. Count the marks from 27 to $K$. $K$ is eight marks to the right of 27.

3. Since each mark represents one-tenth, eight marks represent 0.8.

4. Therefore, $K$ is at 27 + 0.8 = 27.8 on the number line.

To find the value of the square that makes the fractions equivalent, we need to find a number that, when divided by 21, gives the same value as 4 divided by 14. 

To simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us $\frac{2}{7}$. 

Now, we need to find a number that, when placed in the square and divided by 21, gives us the fraction $\frac{2}{7}$. 

Since $21 = 7 \times 3$, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by $\frac{1}{3}$, gives us 2. That number is $2 \times 3 = 6$. 

Therefore, the value of the square that makes the fractions equivalent is 6.

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the original pipe before the workman cut off $\frac{1}{5}$ of it. Since we know that the piece cut off, which is $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original pipe, is 3 meters long, we can set up the following equation:

Let $x$ be the length of the original pipe. Then $\frac{1}{5}x = 3$ meters.

To find $x$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate $x$:

$5 \times \frac{1}{5}x = 5 \times 3$

$x = 15$ meters.

1. For James, since he made 15 successful shots out of 20, we calculate the percentage as follows:
\[ \frac{15}{20} \times 100\% = 0.75 \times 100\% = 75\% \]

2. For Andrew, since he has a success rate of 80%, we need to find out how many shots out of 20 this corresponds to. We set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{20} = 80\% \]
\[ x = 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Therefore, Andrew made 16 successful shots out of 20.

Answer:
- James's percentage of successful shots: [75%].
- Andrew's number of successful shots: [16 out of 20].

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of 6 eggs each can be made out of 94 eggs. 

Step 1: Divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs that can fit in one box.

Step 2: If there's no remainder, the quotient is the number of boxes needed. If there is a remainder, we need one additional box to pack the remaining eggs.

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ 94 \div 6 = 15 \text{ with a remainder of } 4. \]

Since there is a remainder, we cannot fit all 94 eggs into 15 boxes, as there would be 4 eggs left over.

Step 3: Therefore, we need to add one more box to fit the remaining 4 eggs.

Answer: Kim needs \[15 + 1 = 16\] boxes to pack all 94 eggs.

[B] To check if $3\%$ of $50$ equals $6\%$ of $100$, we calculate both expressions. $3\%$ of $50$ is $50 \times \frac{3}{100} = 0.5 \times 3 = 1.5$. $6\%$ of $100$ is $100 \times \frac{6}{100} = 1 \times 6 = 6$. Since 1.5 does not equal 6, option [B] is not true.

[C] To check if $50 \div 30$ equals $30 \div 50$, we calculate both expressions. $50 \div 30$ is approximately $1.6667$ and $30 \div 50$ is $0.6$. Since these two values are not equal, option [C] is not true.

[D] To check if $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ equals $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$, we calculate both expressions. $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ is $5 \times 3 = 15$. $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$ is $3 \times 5 = 15$. Since both expressions equal 15, option [D] is true.

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 4 is their product, which is 12. We then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator of 12. 

For $\frac{1}{3}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get $\frac{4}{12}$. 

For $\frac{1}{4}$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get $\frac{3}{12}$. 

Now we can subtract the two fractions: $\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4-3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$.

Let's check the options:

[A] $\frac{1-1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the numerators and the denominators separately, which is not how fraction subtraction works.

[B] $\frac{1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it only subtracts the denominators, which is not how fraction subtraction works.

[C] $\frac{3-4}{3 \times 4}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the numerators in the wrong order. It should be the numerator of the first fraction minus the numerator of the second fraction.

[D] $\frac{4-3}{3 \times 4}$ is correct because it subtracts the numerators in the correct order and multiplies the denominators to find the common denominator.

The number of balloons carried by the boys is $2m$ (because there are $m$ boys and each carries 2 balloons).
The number of balloons carried by the girls is $2n$ (because there are $n$ girls and each carries 2 balloons).

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total number of balloons:
$2m + 2n$

The expression given is \(2x + 3x\), which simplifies to \(5x\). This is a linear expression, so we are looking for a representation that shows a total length of \(5x\).

Now let's analyze the options:

A. The length of this segment is \(x + 5\), which is not equivalent to \(5x\).

B. The length of this segment is \(2 + 3 + x\), which simplifies to \(5 + x\), not \(5x\).

C. The area of this figure is \(2 \times 3\), which is \(6\), and does not include the variable \(x\), so it cannot represent \(5x\).

D. The area of this figure is \(x \times x + 5 \times x\), which simplifies to \(x^2 + 5x\), not \(5x\).

However, none of the options provided perfectly match the expression \(5x\). The closest representation would be Option D if we only consider the second part of the figure (the \(5 \times x\) rectangle), but this is not entirely correct since there is an additional \(x \times x\) square that is not part of the \(5x\) expression.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information given by the two balance scale images.

From the first image, we can see that one block is heavier than 8 grams because the side with the block is lower than the side with the 8 grams.

From the second image, we can see that three blocks together are lighter than 20 grams because the side with the blocks is higher than the side with the 20 grams.

Now let's consider the options given:

[A] If one block weighs 5 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 5 = 15\) grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image, but it contradicts the first image because 5 grams is less than 8 grams.

[B] If one block weighs 6 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 6 = 18\) grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image and also consistent with the first image because 6 grams is less than 8 grams but the block is shown to be heavier than 8 grams.

[C] If one block weighs 7 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 7 = 21\) grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image where three blocks are lighter than 20 grams.

[D] If one block weighs 8 grams, then three blocks would weigh \(3 \times 8 = 24\) grams, which is also more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image where three blocks are lighter than 20 grams.

To simplify the expression $\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{x}{4}+\frac{x}{2}$, we need to combine the terms. To do this, we should first find a common denominator for the fractions. 

The denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common denominator (LCD) for these is 8 because it is the smallest number that 8, 4, and 2 can all divide into without leaving a remainder.

Now, we need to convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8.

The first fraction, $\frac{3 x}{8}$, already has a denominator of 8, so we do not need to change it.

The second fraction, $\frac{x}{4}$, needs to be converted. Since $4 \times 2 = 8$, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get $\frac{2x}{8}$.

The third fraction, $\frac{x}{2}$, also needs to be converted. Since $2 \times 4 = 8$, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get $\frac{4x}{8}$.

Now, our expression with a common denominator is $\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{2x}{8}+\frac{4x}{8}$.

Next, we add the numerators: $3x + 2x + 4x = 9x$.

So, the combined fraction is $\frac{9x}{8}$.

This is the simplified form of the expression.

The pattern shown in the table and the accompanying images suggests that for an $n \times n$ square shape, the number of black tiles is the square of $(n-2)$. This is because the black tiles form a smaller square in the center of the larger square, with a border of red tiles that is one tile thick on all sides.

For a $3 \times 3$ shape, the number of black tiles is $1^2 = 1$, for a $4 \times 4$ shape, the number of black tiles is $2^2 = 4$, and for a $5 \times 5$ shape, the number of black tiles is $3^2 = 9$.

Continuing with this pattern:

- For a $6 \times 6$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(6-2)^2 = 4^2 = 16$.
- For a $7 \times 7$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(7-2)^2 = 5^2 = 25$.

Once we have the number of black tiles, we can find the number of red tiles by subtracting the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles, which is $n^2$ for an $n \times n$ shape.

- For a $6 \times 6$ shape, the total number of tiles is $6^2 = 36$, so the number of red tiles is $36 - 16 = 20$.
- For a $7 \times 7$ shape, the total number of tiles is $7^2 = 49$, so the number of red tiles is $49 - 25 = 24$.

Therefore, the completed table should be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & Number of Black Tiles & Number of Red Tiles & Total Number of Tiles \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape: 16 black tiles, 20 red tiles, 36 total tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape: 25 black tiles, 24 red tiles, 49 total tiles.

To determine how many red tiles Pat used in the shape with 49 black tiles, we first need to establish the pattern that Pat is following when creating the square shapes with tiles.

From the given information, we can see that:

- A $3 \times 3$ shape (which is $3^2$ in terms of area) has 1 black tile (which is $1^2$) and 8 red tiles.
- A $4 \times 4$ shape (which is $4^2$ or 16 in terms of area) has 4 black tiles (which is $2^2$) and 12 red tiles.
- A $5 \times 5$ shape (which is $5^2$ or 25 in terms of area) has 9 black tiles (which is $3^2$) and 16 red tiles.

From this pattern, we can deduce that the number of black tiles follows the pattern of perfect squares: $1^2$, $2^2$, $3^2$, and so on. Therefore, if Pat used 49 black tiles, we can find the dimension of the square by taking the square root of 49, which is 7. This means Pat made a $7 \times 7$ square.

Now, to find the number of red tiles, we need to subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles in the $7 \times 7$ square:

Total number of tiles in a $7 \times 7$ square = $7^2$ = 49
Number of black tiles = 49 (given)

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 49 - 49 = 0

So, Pat used 0 red tiles in the shape with 49 black tiles. This means the entire $7 \times 7$ square is made up of black tiles only.

Answer: [0 red tiles]

Type of question: Free text response

To determine how many black tiles Pat would need to complete the black part of the shape when using 44 red tiles, we need to identify the pattern in the number of black tiles used in each square shape.

From the provided table and the image, we can see that the number of black tiles in each square shape seems to correspond to a perfect square:

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is $1^2 = 1$ black tile.
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are $2^2 = 4$ black tiles.
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.

From this pattern, we can deduce that for an $n \times n$ shape, there will be $(n-2)^2$ black tiles. To find the value of $n$ that corresponds to using 44 red tiles, we can observe that the total number of tiles in an $n \times n$ shape is $n^2$, and since the number of red tiles is the total number minus the black tiles, we have:

Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n-2)^2$

Given that there are 44 red tiles, we can set up the equation:

$44 = n^2 - (n-2)^2$

Expanding the right side of the equation gives us:

$44 = n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4)$

$44 = 4n - 4$

Adding 4 to both sides and then dividing by 4, we get:

$n = \frac{44 + 4}{4} = \frac{48}{4} = 12$

So the shape is a $12 \times 12$ square. Now, to find the number of black tiles:

Number of black tiles = $(n-2)^2 = (12-2)^2 = 10^2 = 100$

Answer: Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the shape.

\section{M032761}
This is a free-text response question.

To find the pattern for the number of red tiles, let's analyze the given data:

- For a $3 \times 3$ shape, there are $1$ black tile and $8$ red tiles.
- For a $4 \times 4$ shape, there are $4$ black tiles and $12$ red tiles.
- For a $5 \times 5$ shape, there are $9$ black tiles and $16$ red tiles.

Looking at the images, it seems that the black tiles form a smaller square within the larger square, and the red tiles fill the remaining space. The number of black tiles is equal to the area of the smaller square, which is $(n-2) \times (n-2)$, as given in the problem statement.

To find the number of red tiles, we can subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles in the $n \times n$ square.

The total number of tiles in an $n \times n$ square is $n^2$. The number of black tiles is given as $(n-2)^2$. Therefore, the number of red tiles is:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n-2)^2$

Expanding $(n-2)^2$, we get:

$(n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4$

So the number of red tiles is:

Number of red tiles = $n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4)$
Number of red tiles = $n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4$
Number of red tiles = $4n - 4$

The completed line for the $n \times n$ shape in the table would be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & Number of Black Tiles & Number of Red Tiles & Total Number of Tiles \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n - 4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer: Number of Red Tiles: $4n - 4$, Total Number of Tiles: $n^2$

To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply the length by the width. The length of the rectangle is given as \( x + 2 \) and the width is given as \( x \).

So, to calculate the area, we multiply these two expressions:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = (x + 2) \times x \]

Expanding this, we get:

\[ \text{Area} = x \times x + 2 \times x = x^2 + 2x \]

To solve for the value of $2a + 2b + 4$, we can use the given equation $a + b = 25$. 

Step 1: Multiply the entire equation $a + b = 25$ by 2 to maintain the equality, which gives us $2a + 2b = 50$.

Step 2: Then, we add 4 to both sides of the equation to get the value of $2a + 2b + 4$. So, $2a + 2b + 4 = 50 + 4$.

1. To solve the inequality $9x - 6 < 4x + 4$, we need to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the inequality.
2. First, subtract $4x$ from both sides of the inequality to get $5x - 6 < 4$.
3. Next, add $6$ to both sides of the inequality to isolate the term with $x$ on one side. This gives us $5x < 10$.

To determine the next term in the pattern, we need to look at how the sequence is changing from one term to the next. Let's analyze the given terms:

1. The first term is $\frac{1}{2}$.
2. The second term is $\frac{2}{3}$. The numerator and denominator both increased by 1.
3. The third term is $\frac{3}{4}$. Again, the numerator and denominator both increased by 1 from the previous term.
4. The fourth term is $\frac{4}{5}$, with the numerator and denominator both having increased by 1 once more.
5. The fifth term is $\frac{5}{6}$, following the same pattern of increasing both numerator and denominator by 1.

Based on this pattern, to find the next term, we add 1 to both the numerator and denominator of the last term $\frac{5}{6}$.

To determine the pattern of the given sequence, we observe the numerators and denominators of each fraction:

- The numerator of each fraction begins at 1 and increases by 1 with each subsequent term (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...).
- The denominator of each fraction begins at 2 and also increases by 1 with each subsequent term (2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...).

Therefore, the pattern for each term in the sequence is that the numerator is one less than the denominator.

To find term number $n$, we use the pattern we observed. Given that the numerator is always 1 less than the denominator, and the denominator seems to be equal to the term number n plus 1, we can express the nth term as:

$$
\frac{n}{n+1}
$$

Answer: The nth term would be $\frac{n}{n+1}$.

To figure out the pattern, let's look at the numbers and their positions:

Top row: 2, 4, 6, 8 - These are increasing by 2 each time.

Second row: 6, 10, 14 - These are increasing by 4 each time.

Third row: 16, x, 40 - We need to determine the pattern. The difference between 40 and 16 is 24. If we assume that this row is increasing at a constant rate, like the previous rows, then we can divide 24 by the number of gaps between the numbers, which is 2.

24 / 2 = 12

Therefore, if the pattern holds, the number we add to each previous number to get the next number in this row should be 12.

So, to find the value of x, we add 12 to 16:

16 + 12 = 28

1. For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
   - [A] $0 + (-1) = -1$ which is true.
   - [B] $2(0) + (-1) = 0 - 1 = -1$ which is not equal to 5.
   - [C] $3(0) - (-1) = 0 + 1 = 1$ which is not equal to 0.
   - [D] $4(0) - (-1) = 0 + 1 = 1$ which is not equal to 1.

2. For the second pair $(1,3)$:
   - [A] $1 + 3 = 4$ which is not equal to -1.
   - [B] $2(1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5$ which is true.
   - [C] $3(1) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0$ which is true.
   - [D] $4(1) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$ which is true.

Now, we need to find the equation that is true for both pairs. From the above calculations, we can see that none of the equations are satisfied by both pairs of numbers. There must be a mistake in the calculations.

Let's recheck:

1. For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
   - [A] $0 + (-1) = -1$ which is true.
   - [B] $2(0) + (-1) = -1$ which is not equal to 5.

2. For the second pair $(1,3)$:
   - [A] $1 + 3 = 4$ which is not equal to -1.
   - [B] $2(1) + 3 = 5$ which is true.
   - [C] $3(1) - 3 = 0$ which is not true (since $3 - 3 = 0$, but the equation says it should equal 3).
   - [D] $4(1) - 3 = 1$ which is true.

To solve this problem, first, we need to find the value of x. We know that the sum of the lengths of the three pieces must equal the original length of the wood, which is 40 cm.

Let's set up the equation:

\[ 2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the length of each piece:

The first piece: \( 2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \) cm
The second piece: \( x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \) cm
The third piece: \( x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \) cm

Now, to find the longest piece, we compare the lengths of the three pieces:

First piece: 11 cm
Second piece: 15 cm
Third piece: 14 cm

The longest piece is the second piece, which is 15 cm long.

To find the area of the shaded portion of the garden, we need to calculate the total area of the garden and subtract the area of the path.

1. The total area of the garden is the area of the entire rectangle, which is length times width. The length is given as \( x \) meters and the width as \( (x + 4) \) meters. Therefore, the total area is \( x \times (x + 4) = x^2 + 4x \) square meters.

2. The area of the path is the area of a rectangle that is 1 meter wide and \( x \) meters long (since it spans the entire length of the garden). Therefore, the area of the path is \( 1 \times x = x \) square meters.

3. To find the area of the shaded portion, we subtract the area of the path from the total area of the garden:
\[ \text{Shaded area} = \text{Total area} - \text{Path area} \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = (x^2 + 4x) - x \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 4x - x \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = x^2 + 3x \]

To find the perimeter of the square, we first need to find the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of the side by taking the square root of the area.

The area of the square is \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \), so the length of one side is \( \sqrt{144 \mathrm{~cm}^2} = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \).

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side} \). So, the perimeter of the square is \( 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).

Step 2: Find the midpoint of BC.
Since BC is 5.2 cm, the midpoint of BC will be 2.6 cm from B and 2.6 cm from C.

Step 3: Find the distance between the midpoints.
The distance between the midpoints will be the distance from the midpoint of AB to B plus the distance from B to the midpoint of BC.
This is 5 cm (from the midpoint of AB to B) + 2.6 cm (from B to the midpoint of BC) = 7.6 cm.

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider the properties of angles in triangles. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^{\circ} \).

First, let's consider the smaller triangle on the right side of the figure. This triangle has one angle of \( 65^{\circ} \) and another of \( 30^{\circ} \). To find the third angle (which is \( x \)), we can subtract the sum of the known angles from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\[ x + 65^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x + 95^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 95^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 85^{\circ} \]

However, \( 85^{\circ} \) is not one of the options provided, which means we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Upon re-evaluating, we realize that the angle \( x \) is not part of the smaller triangle but is actually part of the larger triangle that includes the \( 45^{\circ} \) angle at the bottom left.

Let's consider the larger triangle now. We have one angle of \( 45^{\circ} \) and we can find the angle at the top by adding the angles from the two smaller triangles that form the larger triangle:

\[ 65^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 95^{\circ} \]

Now we can find \( x \) by subtracting the sum of the known angles from \( 180^{\circ} \):

\[ x + 45^{\circ} + 95^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x + 140^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 180^{\circ} - 140^{\circ} \]
\[ x = 40^{\circ} \]

To determine if triangle PQR is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's evaluate the options:

[A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

This option is stating that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (3 cm and 4 cm) is equal to the square of the longest side (5 cm). Let's check the math:

$3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$
$5^2 = 25$

Since these two are equal, this option supports the fact that triangle PQR could be a right triangle according to the Pythagorean theorem.

[B] $5 < 3 + 4$

This option is stating that the length of the longest side (5 cm) is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. While this is a necessary condition for the existence of a triangle (the Triangle Inequality Theorem), it does not specifically indicate that the triangle is a right triangle.

[C] $3 + 4 = 12 - 5$

This option is simply stating that the sum of the two shorter sides is equal to the difference of 12 and 5, which is true (7 = 7), but it does not provide information about the triangle being a right triangle.

[D] $3 > 5 - 4$

This option is stating that one of the shorter sides (3 cm) is greater than the difference between the longest side and the other shorter side. This is also not relevant to determining whether the triangle is a right triangle.

To determine the shape of the cutout figure, we need to visualize the folding and cutting process described. The paper is folded in half, and then a cut is made along the dotted line. Since the paper is folded, the cut will be mirrored on the other side of the fold, creating a symmetrical shape.

The dotted line indicates a diagonal cut across the folded paper. When the small piece that is cut is opened, it will form a symmetrical shape with two identical triangles back to back. These triangles will share a common base (the fold line), and since the paper was folded in half, the sides of the triangles will be equal in length. This means that each triangle will have two equal sides and one base, which is characteristic of an isosceles triangle.

Therefore, the cutout figure will be composed of two isosceles triangles that are attached at the base.

Since the question asks for the view from directly above, the top view will show the square base with the tips of the triangles touching at the center of the square.

Here are the steps to complete the drawing:

1. Draw a smaller square inside the larger square. This smaller square represents the top view of the base of the shape.
2. The corners of the smaller square should touch the midpoints of the sides of the larger square.
3. Connect the corners of the smaller square to the corners of the larger square with straight lines. These lines represent the folded edges of the triangle flaps as they would appear from the top view.

Following these steps, the completed diagram will show a smaller square inside a larger square, with the corners of the smaller square connected to the corners of the larger square, forming a star-like pattern with the lines.

To solve this, imagine the triangle in the first image being rotated 180 degrees (a half-turn) around point O. This means that the triangle will end up on the opposite side of point O, and it will be flipped over.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:
1. The triangle's right angle is currently in the upper right quadrant.
2. After a half-turn clockwise, the right angle should be in the lower left quadrant.
3. The hypotenuse of the triangle is currently on the left side of the triangle.
4. After the rotation, the hypotenuse should be on the right side of the triangle.
5. The triangle should be flipped over, so the shaded part that is currently on the bottom will be on the top after the rotation.

Looking at the options in the second image:
- Option A shows the triangle in the lower left quadrant, but it is not flipped over; the shaded part is still on the bottom.
- Option B shows the triangle in the lower right quadrant, which is not the correct position after a half-turn clockwise.
- Option C shows the triangle in the upper right quadrant, which is the original position, so it's not the result of a half-turn.

To draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm on the given grid where each small square represents 1 cm, follow these steps:

1. Select a starting point on the grid for the base of the triangle.
2. Count four squares to the right of the starting point to mark the second point of the base, as each square represents 1 cm, and the base needs to be 4 cm.
3. From the starting point, count five squares upwards to find the height of the triangle, which is 5 cm. Mark this point directly above the midpoint of the base. Since the base is 4 cm, the midpoint will be two squares to the right of the starting point.
4. Draw a line from the top point (the height of the triangle) to each end of the base to create the two equal sides of the isosceles triangle.

The resulting figure will be an isosceles triangle with a 4 cm base and a 5 cm height.

Since I'm unable to physically mark points on images, I will describe the steps to locate the points B and C on the graph and how to draw the angle BOC.

1. To mark point B(3,30°):
   - Start from the origin O.
   - Move along the baseline OA until you reach the circle that represents a radius of 3 units.
   - From this point on the circle, make a counterclockwise turn of 30° from the baseline OA. This is where you would mark point B.

2. To mark point C(4,120°):
   - Start from the origin O.
   - Move along the baseline OA until you reach the circle that represents a radius of 4 units.
   - Make a counterclockwise turn of 120° from the baseline OA. This is where you would mark point C.

To draw the angle BOC:
   - Draw a line from point B to the origin O.
   - Draw another line from point C to the origin O.
   - The angle formed between these two lines is angle BOC.

To calculate the measure of angle BOC, you subtract the smaller angle coordinate from the larger one. Since C is at 120° and B is at 30°, you would calculate 120° - 30° = 90°.

Therefore, the measure of angle BOC is 90°.

Angle BOC = 90°.

This problem involves calculating the volume of both the books and the box, then determining how many books can fit inside the box without exceeding its volume.

First, we calculate the volume of one book:
Volume of a book = length × width × height = 20 cm × 15 cm × 6 cm = 1800 cubic centimeters (cm³).

Next, we calculate the volume of the box:
Volume of the box = length × width × height = 36 cm × 30 cm × 20 cm = 21600 cubic centimeters (cm³).

Now, we divide the volume of the box by the volume of one book to determine how many books will fit:
Number of books that will fit = Volume of the box / Volume of a book = 21600 cm³ / 1800 cm³ = 12.

The largest number of books that will fit inside the box is 12.

This question is a free-text response type.

Step 1: Identify the type of triangle.
The information given indicates that AC = BC, which means triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with the two legs (AC and BC) being equal.

Step 2: Analyze the relationship between AB and CX.
It is given that AB is twice as long as CX. Since CX is a segment from C perpendicular to AB, it bisects AB if ABC is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, AX = XB and CX bisects angle ACB.

Step 3: Determine the angles in the triangle.
Since CX bisects angle ACB, we know that angle ACX and angle BCX are equal. Let's call each of these angles θ.

Step 4: Use properties of an isosceles triangle.
In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. So, angles A and B are equal. Since the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

2θ + 2θ = 180° (because angle A = angle B and angle ACX = angle BCX)

Step 5: Solve for θ.
4θ = 180°
θ = 180° / 4
θ = 45°

Since θ is the measure of angle ACX and angle BCX, and angle A equals angle B, the size of angle B is also 45°.

Answer: The size of angle B is 45 degrees.

This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \( b \), we need to use the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal. The lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel, and there is a transversal line that intersects them, creating several angles.

The \( 70^\circ \) angle and the angle marked \( b \) are corresponding angles because they are in the same relative position at the intersection of the transversal with the two parallel lines. According to the Corresponding Angles Postulate, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal.

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is equal to the measure of the corresponding angle, which is \( 70^\circ \).

Answer: \( b = 70^\circ \)

To solve this, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector and then apply that probability to the total number of spins.

First, we count the number of sectors on the spinner. There are 5 sectors in total: Orange, Green, Blue, Red, and Purple.

Since the spinner appears to be divided into equal parts, each sector has an equal chance of being landed on. Therefore, the probability of landing on any one sector, including the red sector, is 1 out of 5, or 1/5.

Now, we apply this probability to the total number of spins:

(1/5) * 600 spins = 120 spins

However, this number is not one of the options provided. It seems there might have been an error in the options or in the interpretation of the image. Given the options, none of them is correct based on our calculation. The closest answer to our calculation is [D] 60, but this is still not accurate. The correct answer should be 120 spins, which is not listed. Therefore, I will choose the closest option provided:

Answer: [D] 60

Please note that this answer is chosen based on the closest option to the correct calculation, even though it is not the exact expected number of times the spinner should land on the red sector.

To determine by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced by the NU Car Motor Company, I will follow these steps:

1. Locate the point on the vertical axis that corresponds to 150 cars produced. This is between the 100 and 200 lines on the graph.
2. Move horizontally across from the 150 mark until I meet the solid line, which represents the actual car production.
3. Once the solid line is reached, move down vertically to the horizontal axis to find the time.

Looking at the graph, the solid line crosses the 150 mark between 11 am and 12 noon. It appears to be closer to 12 noon than to 11 am. The exact time seems to be a few minutes before 12 noon, but it's difficult to be precise without a more granular time scale. For the purpose of providing an answer, I will estimate the time as approximately 11:55 am, recognizing that this is an approximation based on the resolution of the graph provided.

Answer: Approximately 11:55 am.

\section{M032681B}
To find the average number of cars produced per hour on this day by the NU Car Motor Company, we need to look at the solid line on the graph, which represents the actual car production.

First, we need to determine the total number of cars produced by the end of the day. At 4 pm, the graph shows that the total number of cars produced is just under 400. Since the exact number is not clear and the graph does not have more detailed markings, I will estimate based on the closest grid line, which would be 400 cars.

Next, we need to calculate the time span of the production, which is from 8 am to 4 pm. This is an 8-hour period.

Now, to find the average production per hour, we divide the total number of cars produced by the number of hours:

Average number of cars produced per hour = Total number of cars produced / Total number of production hours
Average number of cars produced per hour ≈ 400 cars / 8 hours
Average number of cars produced per hour ≈ 50 cars per hour

So, the average number of cars produced per hour on this day is approximately 50 cars per hour.

To create a pie chart, we need to calculate the percentage of the total that each group represents and then convert these percentages into angles, as a pie chart is a circular chart divided into sectors, illustrating numerical proportion. The entire circle represents 100% of the data, and the angle of each sector represents the proportion out of the whole.

Here are the steps to calculate the angles for each group:

1. Calculate the percentage of students for each group:
- University: \( \frac{50}{400} \times 100\% = 12.5\% \)
- Polytechnic: \( \frac{100}{400} \times 100\% = 25\% \)
- Business college: \( \frac{150}{400} \times 100\% = 37.5\% \)
- Workforce: The remainder is \( 400 - (50 + 100 + 150) = 100 \) students, so \( \frac{100}{400} \times 100\% = 25\% \)

2. Convert these percentages into angles, because there are 360 degrees in a circle:
- University: \( 12.5\% \times 360^\circ = 45^\circ \)
- Polytechnic: \( 25\% \times 360^\circ = 90^\circ \)
- Business college: \( 37.5\% \times 360^\circ = 135^\circ \)
- Workforce: \( 25\% \times 360^\circ = 90^\circ \)

Now, to make the pie chart on the provided circle:

- Begin at the top of the circle and measure the angle for each sector using a protractor.
- Label each sector with its corresponding group:
  - Draw a line at a 45-degree angle from the center of the circle to create the sector for the university.
  - From the end of the university sector, measure a 90-degree angle to create the sector for the polytechnic school.
  - Next, measure a 135-degree angle from the end of the polytechnic sector to create the sector for the business college.
  - The remaining sector, which will also be 90 degrees, will be for those entering the workforce.

Each sector should be labeled with the name of the group it represents and the percentage or number of students. This would result in a pie chart with four sectors of varying sizes, corresponding to the proportions of students planning to go to university, polytechnic school, business college, and entering the workforce.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to estimate the rate of change in sales for both Cherry Cola and Lemon Cola and then project when their sales figures will intersect.

From the graph, we can observe the following:

- Cherry Cola's sales are increasing each year. Between 1998 and 1999, sales increased by about 10 million cans. Between 1999 and 2000, the increase was also about 10 million cans, and between 2000 and 2001, the increase was again about 10 million cans. This suggests a consistent annual increase of about 10 million cans.

- Lemon Cola's sales are decreasing each year. Between 1998 and 1999, sales decreased by about 5 million cans. Between 1999 and 2000, the decrease was about 5 million cans, and between 2000 and 2001, the decrease was again about 5 million cans. This suggests a consistent annual decrease of about 5 million cans.

In 2001, the sales of Cherry Cola were about 30 million cans, and the sales of Lemon Cola were about 50 million cans. The difference between them is 20 million cans.

If Cherry Cola's sales continue to increase by 10 million cans per year and Lemon Cola's sales continue to decrease by 5 million cans per year, the combined rate at which the gap is closing is 15 million cans per year (10 million increase for Cherry Cola + 5 million decrease for Lemon Cola).

To find out how many years it will take for the sales to be the same, we divide the difference by the combined rate of change:

20 million cans / 15 million cans per year = 1.33 years

Since we are starting from the year 2001, we need to add this number to 2001 to find the year when the sales will be equal. However, we can only have whole years, so we need to round up to the nearest whole year:

2001 + 2 = 2003

Therefore, the sales of Cherry Cola and Lemon Cola will be the same in the year 2003.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing either a blue button or a white button from the bag. The total number of buttons in the bag is the sum of red, blue, and white buttons, which is 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 buttons.

The number of favorable outcomes for drawing a blue button is 8, and for drawing a white button is 4. Since these are mutually exclusive events (a button cannot be both blue and white), we can add the number of favorable outcomes for each event to find the total number of favorable outcomes for drawing either a blue or a white button. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 8 (blue) + 4 (white) = 12.

The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of drawing either a blue or a white button is 12 (favorable outcomes) divided by 22 (total outcomes).

Answer: [D] $\frac{12}{22}$

This is a drawing task where you need to complete and label a pie chart based on the given data.

To complete the pie chart, we need to calculate the percentage of the pie chart that each sport represents based on the number of students who favor it. There are 480 students in total.

Here's the breakdown of each sport:

1. Hockey: \( \frac{60}{480} \times 100\% = 12.5\% \) of the pie chart
2. Football: \( \frac{180}{480} \times 100\% = 37.5\% \) of the pie chart
3. Tennis: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100\% = 25\% \) of the pie chart
4. Basketball: \( \frac{120}{480} \times 100\% = 25\% \) of the pie chart

Now, to draw these percentages on the pie chart, we need to calculate the angle that each percentage represents. Since a full circle is 360 degrees, the angle for each sport can be calculated as follows:

1. Hockey: \( 12.5\% \times 360 = 45 \) degrees
2. Football: \( 37.5\% \times 360 = 135 \) degrees
3. Tennis: \( 25\% \times 360 = 90 \) degrees
4. Basketball: \( 25\% \times 360 = 90 \) degrees

To complete the pie chart, you would draw these angles from the center of the circle and label each section with the corresponding sport. The pie chart should reflect the proportions as calculated, with each section sized and labeled accordingly.

To solve this problem, we need to consider that Sue puts the marble back into the bag after drawing it. This means that the composition of the bag remains the same for the next draw as it was for the first draw.

Since there are 5 red marbles and 5 blue marbles in the bag, the total number of marbles is 10. The probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles.

So, the probability of drawing a red marble is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of red marbles}}{\text{Total number of marbles}} = \frac{5}{10} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \]

The age structure of a country can have a significant impact on its population growth. In the graphs provided, we can see the population distribution of Country X and Country Y across three age groups:

1. Ages 0-19 (Going to have children)
2. Ages 20-44 (Having children)
3. Ages 45-89 (Finished having children)

Country X shows a much broader base for the youngest age group (0-19 years), which indicates that there is a large proportion of the population that has not yet reached childbearing age but will do so in the future. This creates a potential for a high number of births in the coming years as this group enters the 20-44 years age range, which is typically associated with childbearing.

On the other hand, Country Y has a narrower base for the youngest age group and a smaller proportion of the population in the 20-44 age group compared to Country X. This suggests that there will be fewer individuals entering the childbearing age and, therefore, potentially fewer births in the future.

The broader base of Country X's population pyramid indicates rapid population growth because as the large young population matures and enters the childbearing age, they will likely contribute to a higher number of births, assuming fertility rates remain constant. In contrast, the narrower base of Country Y suggests slow population growth due to a smaller number of individuals entering the childbearing age and a smaller proportion of the population currently in the childbearing age group.

In summary, the age structure of Country X could lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y because Country X has a larger proportion of its population in the youngest age group, which is the future reproductive segment of the population.

Thought process and reasoning:
To add these two numbers, we need to line up the decimal points and add each column starting from the rightmost digit, carrying over any extra value to the next column on the left if necessary.

1. Write down the numbers, aligning the decimal points:
```
  42.650
+  5.748
```
2. Start adding from the rightmost digit (thousandths place):
   - 0 + 8 = 8
3. Move to the next column (hundredths place):
   - 5 + 4 = 9
4. Move to the next column (tenths place):
   - 6 + 7 = 13, write down 3 and carry over 1 to the next column
5. Add the whole number part, starting with the ones place:
   - 2 + 5 = 7, plus the carried over 1 = 8
6. Move to the tens place:
   - 4 + nothing to add (since there is no tens place in 5.748) = 4

So, we have:
```
  42.650

The image shows two population pyramids comparing the age structure between Country X and Country Y. Population pyramids are graphical illustrations that show the distribution of various age groups in a population, which typically forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for the following reasons:

1. The shape of Country Y's pyramid indicates slow growth, with a larger proportion of the population in the older age groups (45-89 years), as shown by the broad top of the pyramid.

2. The base of Country Y's pyramid, representing the youngest age group (0-19 years), is narrower compared to the middle section (20-44 years), suggesting that there are relatively fewer young people entering the workforce. This demographic trend implies that there will be a smaller working-age population to support the elderly.

3. In contrast, Country X has a broad base, indicating a large young population that will eventually enter the workforce. This suggests a stronger support ratio of working-age individuals to elderly, which could alleviate some of the potential burdens of caring for the elderly.

In summary, Country Y's demographic distribution with a higher percentage of elderly and a smaller percentage of young people entering the workforce suggests more significant challenges in supporting and caring for the aging population.

This is a free-text response question where we need to place the digits 3, 5, 7, and 9 in the boxes to create two two-digit numbers that, when multiplied, give the greatest result.

To maximize the product of two numbers, we should pair the largest digit with the second largest to make the largest possible two-digit number, and then pair the remaining two digits to make the second number. This is because the multiplication of two numbers is maximized when the numbers themselves are as large as possible.

Therefore, we should place the digits 9 and 7 in the boxes of the first number, and the digits 5 and 3 in the boxes of the second number. Since we want the largest number possible, 9 should be in the tens place of the first number and 7 in the ones place. Similarly, 5 should be in the tens place of the second number and 3 in the ones place.

The two numbers would be 97 and 53. The product of these two numbers would be:

\[ 97 \times 53 = 5141 \]

So the greatest result is achieved by placing the digits as follows: 9 and 7 in the first number (97), and 5 and 3 in the second number (53).

Answer: 97 and 53 (97 × 53 = 5141).

To find the fraction equivalent to 0.125, we need to express 0.125 as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator. Since 0.125 has three decimal places, we can write it as a fraction with a denominator of 1000 to ensure we account for all the decimal places. 

So, 0.125 is equivalent to $\frac{125}{1000}$. However, this fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 125 in this case. 

Dividing both by 125, we get $\frac{125 \div 125}{1000 \div 125} = \frac{1}{8}$.

Now let's look at the options to see which one matches this simplified fraction:

[A] $\frac{125}{100}$ is not correct because it simplifies to $\frac{5}{4}$, which is not equivalent to $\frac{1}{8}$.

[B] $\frac{125}{1,000}$ is correct because it simplifies to $\frac{1}{8}$, which is equivalent to 0.125.

[C] $\frac{125}{10,000}$ is not correct because it simplifies to $\frac{1}{80}$, which is not equivalent to $\frac{1}{8}$.

[D] $\frac{125}{100,000}$ is not correct because it simplifies to $\frac{1}{800}$, which is not equivalent to $\frac{1}{8}$.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the height of the bush and the length of its shadow. From the table, we can see that as the height of the bush increases, the shadow length also increases proportionally. We can find the ratio of the height of the bush to the shadow length for the given data points to see if there is a consistent ratio.

For the first row: 
Bush height = 20 cm, Shadow length = 16 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 20/16 = 5/4

For the second row: 
Bush height = 40 cm, Shadow length = 32 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 40/32 = 5/4

For the third row: 
Bush height = 60 cm, Shadow length = 48 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 60/48 = 5/4

For the fourth row: 
Bush height = 80 cm, Shadow length = 64 cm
Ratio = Bush height / Shadow length = 80/64 = 5/4

The ratio is consistent for all the given data points, which is 5/4. This means that for every 5 cm of bush height, the shadow length is 4 cm.

Now, we need to find the shadow length for a bush that is 50 cm tall. We can use the consistent ratio to find this:

Bush height = 50 cm
Ratio = 5/4

Shadow length = (Bush height / 5) * 4
Shadow length = (50 / 5) * 4
Shadow length = 10 * 4
Shadow length = 40 cm

- A $5 \times 5$ square has 9 black tiles.

We can see a pattern that the number of black tiles is the square of the number that is one less than the dimension of the square (since $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, and so on).

If a shape has a total of 64 tiles, then the dimension of the shape is $8 \times 8$ (since $8^2 = 64$). Following the pattern, the number of black tiles would be the square of one less than 8, which is $7^2 = 49$.

Now, to find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

Number of red tiles = Total number of tiles - Number of black tiles
Number of red tiles = 64 - 49
Number of red tiles = 15

Answer:
- Black tiles: 49
- Red tiles: 15

To find an expression equivalent to $4(3+x)$, we need to use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. This property states that $a(b+c) = ab + ac$. 

Applying this to the given expression:

$4(3+x) = 4 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot x = 12 + 4x$

Therefore, the equivalent expression is $12 + 4x$.

Answer: [C] $12+4x$

\section{M042235}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve for the values of $x$ and $y$, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, I will use the elimination method.

Step 1: Align the equations to prepare for elimination.
$$x + y = 12 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}$$
$$2x + 5y = 36 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}$$

Step 2: Multiply Equation 1 by 2 to align the coefficients of $x$ with those in Equation 2.
$$2(x + y) = 2(12)$$
$$2x + 2y = 24 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}$$

Step 3: Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to eliminate $x$.
$$(2x + 5y) - (2x + 2y) = 36 - 24$$
$$3y = 12$$

Step 4: Solve for $y$.
$$y = \frac{12}{3}$$
$$y = 4$$

Step 5: Substitute $y = 4$ into Equation 1 to solve for $x$.
$$x + 4 = 12$$
$$x = 12 - 4$$
$$x = 8$$

Answer: [D] $x=8, y=4$

\section{M032331}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total degrees the minute hand turns from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

Step 1: Calculate the degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.
- From 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., the minute hand completes 40 minutes of rotation.
- Since the minute hand completes a full 360-degree rotation every 60 minutes, we can calculate the degrees turned in 40 minutes as follows:
  Degrees turned in 40 minutes = (40 minutes / 60 minutes) * 360 degrees
  Degrees turned in 40 minutes = (2/3) * 360 degrees
  Degrees turned in 40 minutes = 240 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the degrees turned from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.
- From 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., the minute hand completes one full rotation, which is 360 degrees.

Step 3: Add the degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. and from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. together.
- Total degrees turned = Degrees turned from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. + Degrees turned from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.
- Total degrees turned = 240 degrees + 360 degrees
- Total degrees turned = 600 degrees

Answer: [B] $600^{\circ}$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the shaded region, we first need to calculate the area of the entire rectangle and then subtract the area of the unshaded triangle.

The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

The length is 16 cm and the width is 6 cm, so:
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 16 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Next, we calculate the area of the unshaded triangle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

The base of the triangle is 8 cm and the height is the same as the width of the rectangle, which is 6 cm, so:
\[ \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Finally, we subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region:
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of rectangle} - \text{Area of triangle} \]
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 - 24 \, \text{cm}^2 = 72 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Answer: [D] 72

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of a square, we need to know the length of one of its sides. Since the perimeter of the square is given, we can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by the number of sides a square has, which is 4.

Step 1: Divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.
\[ \text{Side length} = \frac{36 \mathrm{~cm}}{4} = 9 \mathrm{~cm} \]

Step 2: Calculate the area of the square using the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side} \times \text{side} \).
\[ \text{Area} = 9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \]

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial conditions and how they change after Megan takes a candy. Initially, there are an equal number of each color of candy, so the probability of getting a pink candy is the same for each color.

When Megan takes a pink candy, there is now one less pink candy in the machine, but the number of candies of the other colors remains the same. This means that the proportion of pink candies has decreased relative to the other colors.

Therefore, it is less likely for Peter to get a pink candy compared to Megan, because there is now one less pink candy available.

Answer: [D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

\section{M032681C}
To determine during which hour the most cars were produced, we need to look at the solid line on the graph and identify the point where the slope of the line is the steepest. The slope of the line represents the rate of car production, so the steepest slope indicates the fastest production rate within a given hour.

Based on the graph, the slope of the solid line is steepest between 2 pm and 3 pm. This indicates that the most cars were produced during the hour between 2 pm and 3 pm.

First, let's analyze the initial situation before the increase in staff members at the restaurant with 30 employees.

The numbers of staff members are: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 30. 

To find the median, we arrange the numbers in ascending order (which is already done), and since there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle number. 

Median (initially) = 19 (since it is the third number in the ordered list).

To calculate the mean, we add up all the numbers and divide by the number of data points:

Mean (initially) = (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20

Now, let's consider the change: the restaurant with 30 staff members increases its number to 50. 

The new set of numbers will be: 12, 18, 19, 21, and 50. 

To find the new median, we again arrange the numbers in ascending order (which they already are), and since there is still an odd number of data points, the median is the middle number.

Median (after increase) = 19 (since it is still the third number in the ordered list). The median remains unchanged because the increase did not affect the middle value.

To find the new mean, we add up all the new numbers and divide by the number of data points:

Mean (after increase) = (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Answer:
- The median would remain the same at 19.
- The mean would increase from 20 to 24.
