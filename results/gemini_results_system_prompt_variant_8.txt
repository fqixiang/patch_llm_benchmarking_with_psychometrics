\section{M032595}
 The question is a multiple-choice question.

To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of caps that are either white or green, and then multiply that percentage by 200.

The percentage of caps that are white is 30%.

The percentage of caps that are green is 25%.

The percentage of caps that are either white or green is 30% + 25% = 55%.

Therefore, the total number of caps that are either white or green is 55% of 200, which is 55 * 200 / 100 = 110.

The answer is [C].

\section{M032626}
**Type of question:** Multiple choice

**Thought process:**

1. Prime factors are the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, give the original number.
2. To find the prime factors of 36, we can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
3. 36 divided by 2 is 18, which is not a prime number.
4. We can then divide 18 by 2, which gives us 9.
5. 9 is a prime number, so we have found one of the prime factors of 36.
6. We can then divide 9 by 3, which gives us 3.
7. 3 is a prime number, so we have found another prime factor of 36.
8. Since we cannot divide 3 any further by prime numbers, we have found all of the prime factors of 36.

**Answer:** [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

\section{M032662}
 First, this is a multiple-choice question.

The question is asking about the location of $N$ on the number line. We know that $P$ and $Q$ are two fractions on the number line, and that $P \times Q = N$. We can use this information to figure out where $N$ is located.

First, let's think about what $P \times Q$ means. This is the same as asking what is the product of $P$ and $Q$. The product of two numbers is the number we get when we multiply them together. So, $P \times Q$ is the number we get when we multiply $P$ and $Q$ together.

Now, let's think about where $N$ is located. We know that $N$ is the product of $P$ and $Q$. So, $N$ must be located somewhere between $P$ and $Q$ on the number line. This is because the product of two numbers is always between the two numbers.

So, the answer to the question is that $N$ is located between $P$ and $Q$ on the number line. The correct answer is C.

\section{M042031}
**Type of question:** Multiple choice.

**Thought process and reasoning:**

1. To find the value of the missing numerator, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 21 is 42.
2. To find the equivalent fraction with a denominator of 42, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 3 (42 รท 14 = 3). This gives us $\frac{4 \times 3}{14 \times 3} = \frac{12}{42}$.
3. Now we can find the missing numerator in the second fraction by setting the two fractions equal to each other: $\frac{12}{42} = \frac{\square}{21}$.
4. Cross-multiplying, we get $12 \times 21 = 42 \times \square$.
5. Solving for $\square$, we get $\square = 12 \times 21 \div 42 = 6$.

Thought process: 
- The table shows that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape. 
- The number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape. 
- For the shape with a total of 64 tiles, the number of black tiles is (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 15. 
- The number of red tiles is (4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4) = 20.

Answer: [D].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
 First, the question type is multiple choice.

Second, the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles in the first three shapes are given in the table. We can see that the number of black tiles increases by 3 for each shape, and the number of red tiles increases by 4 for each shape.

Third, we can use the information in the table to find the number of red tiles in the shape that used 49 black tiles. The number of black tiles in the shape is 49, so the number of red tiles in the shape is 49 + 4 = 53.

Therefore, the answer is (D).
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 This is a multiple-choice question.

In the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile for every 8 red tiles.

In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles for every 12 red tiles.

In the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles for every 16 red tiles.

So, for every 8, 12, or 16 red tiles, there is 1, 4, or 9 black tiles, respectively. Since 44 is closest to 48 (which is 12 x 4), there should be 4 black tiles.

The answer is [D].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 This is a free-text response question.

We can see that the number of black tiles is the square of the number of rows minus 1. 
So, for a square with n rows, the number of black tiles is (n-1)^2.

The number of red tiles is always 4 times the number of rows minus 3. 
So, for a square with n rows, the number of red tiles is 4(n-1).

The total number of tiles is the sum of the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles. 
So, for a square with n rows, the total number of tiles is (n-1)^2 + 4(n-1).

Therefore, the completed line in the table is:

| Shape | Number of Black Tiles | Number of Red Tiles | Total Number of Tiles |
|---|---|---|---|
| $n \times n$ | $(n-1)^2$ | $4(n-1)$ | $(n-1)^2 + 4(n-1)$ |

2. Thought process and reasoning:
The total length of the three pieces is $40 \mathrm{~cm}$. So, we can write:

$2x-5+x+7+x+6=40$

Simplifying the equation:

$4x+8=40$

Subtracting $8$ from both sides:

$4x=32$

Dividing both sides by $4$:

$x=8$

Now, we can find the length of the longest piece by substituting $x=8$ into any of the three expressions:

$2x-5=2(8)-5=16-5=\boxed{11}$

$x+7=8+7=\boxed{15}$

$x+6=8+6=\boxed{14}$

Therefore, the length of the longest piece is $15 \mathrm{~cm}$.

First, we need to find the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width. The length of the rectangle is x+4 meters, and the width is x meters. So, the area of the rectangle is (x+4)(x) = x^2 + 4x square meters.

Next, we need to find the area of the path. The path is 1 meter wide, and it runs the entire length of the rectangle. So, the area of the path is 1 * (x+4) = x+4 square meters.

Finally, we need to subtract the area of the path from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded portion of the garden. So, the area of the shaded portion of the garden is (x^2 + 4x) - (x+4) = x^2 + 3x - 4 square meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is [D].

Therefore, the answer is [D].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032402}
 The question is a multiple-choice question.

To determine if a triangle is a right angle triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this question, the sides of the triangle are 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. Let's check if the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied:

3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
5^2 = 25

Since 9 + 16 = 25, the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied. Therefore, the triangle is a right angle triangle.

The correct answer is [A] 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2.

 1. To mark the point $B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)$, we first find the point on the graph that is 3 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin through this point, making an angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the baseline $O A$. The point where this line intersects the circle is the point $B$.

2. To mark the point $C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)$, we first find the point on the graph that is 4 units away from the origin. We then draw a line from the origin through this point, making an angle of $120^{\circ}$ with the baseline $O A$. The point where this line intersects the circle is the point $C$.

3. To draw the angle $B O C$, we simply connect the points $B$ and $C$ with a straight line.

4. To measure the angle $B O C$, we use a protractor to measure the angle between the line $B O$ and the line $O C$. We find that the angle $B O C$ is $90^{\circ}$.

Therefore, the answer is $90^{\circ}$.

\section{M032681A}
 The question is a multiple-choice question. The options are not provided, but we can still answer the question by analyzing the graph.

The graph shows the number of cars produced by the NU Car Motor Company during a particular day. The solid line shows the actual number of cars produced, while the dotted line shows the total number of cars that would have been produced if the rate of production were constant.

To determine by what time 150 cars had been produced, we need to find the point on the graph where the solid line intersects the dotted line. This point corresponds to the time when the actual number of cars produced equals the total number of cars that would have been produced if the rate of production were constant.

By visual inspection, we can see that the solid line intersects the dotted line at the point corresponding to 10:30 am. Therefore, the answer to the question is 10:30 am.
