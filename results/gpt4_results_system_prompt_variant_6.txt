Thought process and reasoning:
To find out how many zeds Ann will get, we first need to determine how many zeds Jenny gets and then subtract that amount from the total.

1. Calculate the amount Jenny gets by multiplying the total amount ($560$ zeds) by Jenny's share ($\frac{3}{8}$).
2. Subtract the amount Jenny gets from the total amount to find out how many zeds Ann gets.

Let's calculate Jenny's share:
Jenny's share = Total amount × Jenny's fraction
Jenny's share = $560 × \frac{3}{8}$

Now, we can calculate this:
$560 × \frac{3}{8} = 70 × 3 = 210$ zeds (since $560 ÷ 8 = 70$ and $70 × 3 = 210$)

Now, subtract Jenny's share from the total to find Ann's share:
Ann's share = Total amount - Jenny's share
Ann's share = $560 - 210 = 350$ zeds

Answer: Ann will get $350$ zeds.

To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions together. Since they have different denominators, we can't add them directly. We need to find a common denominator. The easiest way to do this is to convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1000, since 1000 is a multiple of 100.

The first fraction is $\frac{4}{100}$. To convert this to a denominator of 1000, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10, which gives us $\frac{40}{1000}$.

The second fraction is already with a denominator of 1000, so it stays $\frac{3}{1000}$.

Now we can add the two fractions:

$\frac{40}{1000} + \frac{3}{1000} = \frac{43}{1000}$

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

$43 \div 1000 = 0.043$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: [A] 0.043

To estimate the value of the given expression, we can round the numbers to the nearest whole number or a number that is easy to work with mentally.

Step by step:
1. Estimate the numerator: $7.21$ is close to $7$, and $3.86$ is close to $4$. So the estimated product of the numerator is $7 \times 4$.
2. Estimate the denominator: $10.09$ is close to $10$.
3. Now, we have an estimated fraction of $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$.

Looking at the options:
[A] $\frac{7 \times 3}{10}$ is an underestimate because $3.86$ is closer to $4$ than $3$.
[B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$ matches our estimated fraction.
[C] $\frac{7 \times 3}{11}$ is an underestimate in the numerator and an overestimate in the denominator.
[D] $\frac{7 \times 4}{11}$ is correct in the numerator but an overestimate in the denominator.

Answer: [B] $\frac{7 \times 4}{10}$

\section{M032626}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To express a number as a product of prime factors, we need to break it down into its prime components. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.

Step by step, we can do this for 36 as follows:
1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see if 36 is divisible by it. Since 36 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. Dividing 36 by 2 gives us 18.
2. Now we have 18, which is also even, so we divide by 2 again. Dividing 18 by 2 gives us 9.
3. 9 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3. 9 is divisible by 3. Dividing 9 by 3 gives us 3.
4. We are left with 3, which is a prime number itself.

So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. When we multiply these together (2 x 2 x 3 x 3), we get 36.

Answer: [D] $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand the basic properties of fractions and their representation on a number line. The fractions P and Q are both located between 0 and 1, which means they are both less than 1. When multiplying two fractions that are less than 1, the result will be smaller than either of the original fractions.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. This option places N to the right of 1, which would imply that N is greater than 1. This cannot be correct because multiplying two fractions less than 1 cannot result in a number greater than 1.

B. This option places N between Q and 1. Since Q is less than 1, and we know that N must be less than Q (because P is also less than 1), this cannot be the correct position for N.

C. This option places N between P and Q. Since both P and Q are less than 1, their product N must be less than either P or Q. Therefore, this is the correct position for N.

D. This option places N to the left of P, which could be a possibility if P and Q were very small fractions. However, without specific values for P and Q, we cannot determine if N should be to the left of P.

Based on the reasoning above, the correct answer is the one that places N between 0 and P, which is the only position that guarantees N is less than both P and Q.

This is a free-text response question.

To find the greatest result when multiplying two two-digit numbers formed by the digits 3, 5, 7, and 9, we need to consider the value of each place in the two-digit numbers. Since we want the largest product, we should place the larger digits in the tens place because the tens place contributes more to the overall value of the number than the ones place.

The largest two digits are 9 and 7, so they should be in the tens places. We can place 9 in the tens place of the first number and 7 in the tens place of the second number. This leaves us with the digits 3 and 5 for the ones places.

In multiplication, the tens place has a bigger impact on the product than the ones place. To maximize the product, it's better to multiply larger numbers together. Therefore, we should put the larger remaining digit (5) with the larger tens digit (9) to get the maximum value. This leaves us with 3 to go with the tens digit of 7.

So the two numbers should be 95 and 73 to get the greatest result when multiplied together.

Answer: The digits should be placed as follows: 9 and 5 in the first number, and 7 and 3 in the second number, forming the numbers 95 and 73.

To express the value of $256 \times 4,096$ as a power of 4, we can use the table to find the corresponding powers of 4 for each of the given numbers.

From the table, we can see that:
- $256$ corresponds to $4^4$
- $4,096$ corresponds to $4^6$

When multiplying powers with the same base, we add the exponents. Therefore, to find the power of 4 that represents $256 \times 4,096$, we add the exponents of the corresponding powers of 4:

$4^4 \times 4^6 = 4^{4+6} = 4^{10}$

1. The number line shows the numbers 26 and 28, with 27 in between. The marks between 27 and 28 are equally spaced, indicating tenths.
2. There are ten small marks between 27 and 28, so each mark represents 0.1.
3. The mark labeled $K$ is eight marks to the right of 27, which means it is 0.8 more than 27.

Therefore, $K$ represents 27 + 0.8 = 27.8.

To find the value of the square that makes the fractions equivalent, we need to find a common factor or a way to scale the fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ so that the denominator is 21. 

The fraction $\frac{4}{14}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us $\frac{2}{7}$. 

Now, we need to find a number that, when placed in the square, gives us a fraction equivalent to $\frac{2}{7}$ but with a denominator of 21. To scale $\frac{2}{7}$ up to a denominator of 21, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 (since $7 \times 3 = 21$). 

So, $2 \times 3 = 6$. 

Therefore, the fraction equivalent to $\frac{4}{14}$ with a denominator of 21 is $\frac{6}{21}$.

To find the fraction equivalent to the decimal 0.125, we need to understand the place value of the decimal. The decimal 0.125 has a 1 in the tenths place, a 2 in the hundredths place, and a 5 in the thousandths place. This means that 0.125 is the same as 125 thousandths.

To write this as a fraction, we take the number 125 and put it over the place value, which is 1000 (since the last digit, 5, is in the thousandths place).

So, the equivalent fraction is $\frac{125}{1,000}$.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the original pipe before the workman cut off $\frac{1}{5}$ of it. Since the piece cut off is $\frac{1}{5}$ of the original pipe and is 3 meters long, we can set up the following equation to find the length of the original pipe:

Let $x$ be the length of the original pipe. Then $\frac{1}{5}x = 3$ meters.

To find $x$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

$x = 3 \times 5$

$x = 15$

Therefore, the original pipe was 15 meters long.

To find the percentage of successful shots for James, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of Successful Shots} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Successful Shots}}{\text{Total Number of Shots}} \right) \times 100 \]

For James:
\[ \text{Percentage of Successful Shots} = \left( \frac{15}{20} \right) \times 100 = 75 \% \]

To find the number of successful shots for Andrew, we rearrange the formula to solve for the number of successful shots:

\[ \text{Number of Successful Shots} = \left( \text{Percentage of Successful Shots} \times \frac{\text{Total Number of Shots}}{100} \right) \]

For Andrew:
\[ \text{Number of Successful Shots} = 80 \% \times \frac{20}{100} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of 6 eggs each can be filled with 94 eggs. The thought process involves dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each box can hold.

Step 1: Divide the total number of eggs (94) by the number of eggs per box (6).

Step 2: Determine if there is a remainder. If there is a remainder, that means an additional box will be needed for the remaining eggs.

Step 3: Calculate the number of full boxes and add one if there is a remainder.

Let's do the calculation:

94 ÷ 6 = 15 remainder 4

This means 15 boxes will be completely full, and we will have 4 eggs left over. Since we can't have a fraction of a box and the question asks for the smallest number of boxes needed, we need to add one more box for the remaining eggs.

Answer: [16 boxes]

2. To solve this question, we need to evaluate each of the number sentences to see which one is true.

[A] $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50=50 \%$ of 3
To evaluate this, we calculate both sides of the equation:
- $\frac{3}{10}$ of $50$ is $50 \times \frac{3}{10} = 5 \times 3 = 15$.
- $50 \%$ of $3$ is $3 \times \frac{50}{100} = 3 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1.5$.
These two values are not equal, so option [A] is not true.

[B] $3 \%$ of $50=6 \%$ of 100
To evaluate this, we calculate both sides of the equation:
- $3 \%$ of $50$ is $50 \times \frac{3}{100} = 0.5 \times 3 = 1.5$.
- $6 \%$ of $100$ is $100 \times \frac{6}{100} = 1 \times 6 = 6$.
These two values are not equal, so option [B] is not true.

[C] $50 \div 30=30 \div 50$
To evaluate this, we calculate both sides of the equation:
- $50 \div 30$ is $\frac{50}{30}$ which simplifies to $\frac{5}{3}$.
- $30 \div 50$ is $\frac{30}{50}$ which simplifies to $\frac{3}{5}$.
These two values are reciprocals of each other, not equal, so option [C] is not true.

[D] $\frac{3}{10} \times 50=\frac{5}{10} \times 30$
To evaluate this, we calculate both sides of the equation:
- $\frac{3}{10} \times 50$ is $5 \times 3 = 15$.
- $\frac{5}{10} \times 30$ is $3 \times 5 = 15$.
These two values are equal, so option [D] is true.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To subtract two fractions with different denominators, you need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 1/3 and 1/4 is 12 (since 3 and 4 both divide into 12). Then you convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12. 

For 1/3, multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get 4/12. 
For 1/4, multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get 3/12.

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, you can subtract the numerators and keep the common denominator:

$\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4-3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$

Looking at the options:

[A] $\frac{1-1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because you don't subtract the denominators to find a common denominator.

[B] $\frac{1}{4-3}$ is incorrect because it suggests you only need to subtract the denominators, which is not how you find a common denominator.

[C] $\frac{3-4}{3 \times 4}$ is incorrect because it subtracts the denominators in the wrong order (it should be the larger minus the smaller to get a positive result), and also because it does not reflect the correct numerators after finding a common denominator.

[D] $\frac{4-3}{3 \times 4}$ is correct because it reflects the correct numerators after finding a common denominator (4 and 3) and multiplies the denominators to find the common denominator (12).

From the second image, we can see that three metal blocks together are lighter than 20 grams because the side with the blocks is higher than the side with the 20 grams.

Now, let's consider the options given:

[A] If one block weighs 5 grams, then three blocks would weigh 15 grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image. However, 5 grams is less than 8 grams, which contradicts the first image.

[B] If one block weighs 6 grams, then three blocks would weigh 18 grams, which is less than 20 grams. This is consistent with the second image. However, 6 grams is less than 8 grams, which contradicts the first image.

[C] If one block weighs 7 grams, then three blocks would weigh 21 grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image.

[D] If one block weighs 8 grams, then three blocks would weigh 24 grams, which is more than 20 grams. This contradicts the second image.

Based on the analysis, the only option that is consistent with both images is option [B], where each block weighs 6 grams. This satisfies the condition that one block is heavier than 8 grams (as seen in the first image) and three blocks together are lighter than 20 grams (as seen in the second image).

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the total cost of the taxi ride is composed of two parts: the basic charge and the charge per kilometer. 

The basic charge is a fixed amount that does not depend on the distance traveled, which is given as 25 zeds. 

The charge per kilometer is a variable amount that depends on the distance traveled. Since it is 0.2 zeds for each kilometer, we multiply this rate by the number of kilometers, $n$, to find the total charge for the distance traveled.

Therefore, the total cost of the taxi ride would be the sum of the basic charge and the charge for the distance traveled, which is represented by the equation: 

Total Cost = Basic Charge + (Charge per Kilometer × Number of Kilometers)

In mathematical terms, this is:

Total Cost = 25 + (0.2 × $n$)

Now, let's match this with the given options:

[A] $25+0.2 n$ - This option correctly represents the basic charge plus the charge per kilometer multiplied by the number of kilometers, which matches our equation.

[B] $25 \times 0.2 n$ - This option incorrectly suggests multiplying the basic charge by the charge per kilometer and the number of kilometers, which does not match our equation.

[C] $0.2 \times(25+n)$ - This option incorrectly suggests multiplying the charge per kilometer by the sum of the basic charge and the number of kilometers, which is not the correct representation.

[D] $0.2 \times 25+n$ - This option incorrectly suggests multiplying the charge per kilometer by the basic charge and then adding the number of kilometers, which is not the correct representation.

To simplify the expression $\frac{3 x}{8}+\frac{x}{4}+\frac{x}{2}$, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions to combine them. The denominators are 8, 4, and 2. The least common denominator (LCD) for these denominators is 8.

Step 1: Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8. 
- The first fraction already has a denominator of 8, so it stays the same: $\frac{3 x}{8}$.
- The second fraction has a denominator of 4, which goes into 8 two times. Therefore, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get $\frac{2x}{8}$.
- The third fraction has a denominator of 2, which goes into 8 four times. Therefore, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4 to get $\frac{4x}{8}$.

Step 2: Combine the fractions now that they have the same denominator.
- $\frac{3 x}{8} + \frac{2 x}{8} + \frac{4 x}{8} = \frac{3x + 2x + 4x}{8}$

Step 3: Add the numerators.

To solve this, we can analyze the pattern in the number of black and red tiles as the shapes increase in size. From the examples given, we can deduce that the number of black tiles seems to be the square of the number of rows/columns minus 1 (since the shapes are squares, the number of rows is equal to the number of columns). Let's verify this pattern:

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile, and $3 - 1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, but since there is only one black tile, it seems like the pattern actually starts at $2 \times 2$ with 1 black tile.
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles, and $4 - 1 = 3$, $3^2 = 9$, but we only count the inner square, so it is $2 \times 2$ with 4 black tiles.
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles, and $5 - 1 = 4$, $4^2 = 16$, but again we only count the inner $3 \times 3$ square, so there are 9 black tiles.

Continuing this pattern:
- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, we would expect the inner $4 \times 4$ square to be black, so there should be $4^2 = 16$ black tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, we would expect the inner $5 \times 5$ square to be black, so there should be $5^2 = 25$ black tiles.

These numbers are already provided in the table for the black tiles, so our pattern holds.

Now, let's calculate the number of red tiles. The total number of tiles for a shape is the square of the side length since it's a square shape. Therefore:

- For the $6 \times 6$ shape, the total number of tiles is $6^2 = 36$ tiles. Subtracting the black tiles, we get $36 - 16 = 20$ red tiles.
- For the $7 \times 7$ shape, the total number of tiles is $7^2 = 49$ tiles. Subtracting the black tiles, we get $49 - 25 = 24$ red tiles.

So the completed table should be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}

\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$3 \times 3$ & 1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
$4 \times 4$ & 4 & 12 & 16 \\
\hline
$5 \times 5$ & 9 & 16 & 25 \\
\hline
$6 \times 6$ & 16 & 20 & 36 \\
\hline
$7 \times 7$ & 25 & 24 & 49 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{M032760A}
The image provided shows two square shapes made from red and black tiles. The first square is a $3 \times 3$ square with 1 black tile in the center and 8 red tiles surrounding it. The second square is a $4 \times 4$ square with 4 black tiles forming a smaller $2 \times 2$ square in the center and 12 red tiles surrounding them.

From the provided table and the pattern observed in the image, we can deduce that for each square shape, the number of black tiles forms a smaller square in the center, and the red tiles surround this black square. The side length of the black square seems to be one less than the side length of the overall square shape.

Given this pattern, the number of black tiles appears to be the square of one less than the side length of the overall square. For example:

- In the $3 \times 3$ shape, the side length of the black square is $2$ (since $3 - 1 = 2$), and there is $2^2 = 4$ black tiles, but one of them is missing since it is a $3 \times 3$ square, so there is only $1$ black tile.
- In the $4 \times 4$ shape, the side length of the black square is $3$ (since $4 - 1 = 3$), and there are $3^2 = 9$ black tiles.
- In the $5 \times 5$ shape, the side length of the black square is $4$ (since $5 - 1 = 4$), and there are $4^2 = 16$ black tiles.

So, if Pat made a shape with a total of $64$ tiles, this would be an $8 \times 8$ square because $8^2 = 64$. Following the pattern, the number of black tiles would be the square of $7$ (since $8 - 1 = 7$), which is $7^2 = 49$ black tiles. The number of red tiles would then be the total number of tiles minus the number of black tiles: $64 - 49 = 15$ red tiles.

Therefore, for the $8 \times 8$ shape with a total of 64 tiles, there would be 49 black tiles and 15 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
The question is asking for a free-text response based on a pattern established in the table provided. Let's analyze the pattern to find out how many red tiles Pat used in the shape with 49 black tiles.

From the table, we can see a pattern in the number of black tiles used for each square shape:

- $3 \times 3$ shape: 1 black tile (which is $1^2$)
- $4 \times 4$ shape: 4 black tiles (which is $2^2$)
- $5 \times 5$ shape: 9 black tiles (which is $3^2$)

We can deduce that for an $n \times n$ shape, the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$. Since Pat used 49 black tiles, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $(n-2)^2 = 49$. 

Solving for $n$:

\[(n-2)^2 = 49\]
\[n-2 = \sqrt{49}\]
\[n-2 = 7\]
\[n = 7 + 2\]
\[n = 9\]

So, the shape is a $9 \times 9$ square. The total number of tiles in a $9 \times 9$ shape is $9^2 = 81$.

Now, to find the number of red tiles, we subtract the number of black tiles from the total number of tiles:

\[ \text{Number of red tiles} = \text{Total number of tiles} - \text{Number of black tiles} \]
\[ \text{Number of red tiles} = 81 - 49 \]
\[ \text{Number of red tiles} = 32 \]

Pat used 32 red tiles in the shape with 49 black tiles.

Answer: [32 red tiles]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
This is a free text response question.

To solve this problem, let's look at the pattern of the black tiles in the square shapes. Based on the information given:

- A $3 \times 3$ shape has 1 black tile in the middle.
- A $4 \times 4$ shape has 4 black tiles in a $2 \times 2$ square in the middle.
- A $5 \times 5$ shape has 9 black tiles in a $3 \times 3$ square in the middle.

It seems that for an $n \times n$ square shape, the number of black tiles forms an $(n-2) \times (n-2)$ square. This is because the outermost layer of the square shape is composed of red tiles only.

Now, we need to determine the size of the square shape that uses 44 red tiles. Since the red tiles form the outer layer, an $n \times n$ square will have $4(n-1)$ red tiles (because there are $n-1$ tiles on each side of the square, and there are 4 sides, but we must subtract the 4 corner tiles because they are counted twice).

Setting up the equation for the number of red tiles:
\[ 4(n-1) = 44 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n-1 = \frac{44}{4} \]
\[ n-1 = 11 \]
\[ n = 12 \]

So, Pat is making a $12 \times 12$ square shape. To find out how many black tiles Pat would need, we calculate the area of the inner $(n-2) \times (n-2)$ square, which is the area covered by black tiles:
\[ (12-2) \times (12-2) = 10 \times 10 = 100 \]

Therefore, Pat would need 100 black tiles to complete the black part of the $12 \times 12$ shape using 44 red tiles.

Answer: [100 black tiles]
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
This is a free-text response question where we need to complete a pattern for determining the number of tiles needed to make a square of any size.

To find the pattern, let's look at the given examples:

- For a $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile, which can be represented as $(3-2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.
- For a $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles, which can be represented as $(4-2)^2 = 2^2 = 4$.
- For a $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles, which can be represented as $(5-2)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.

So, the number of black tiles follows the pattern $(n-2)^2$, where $n$ is the size of the square.

For the number of red tiles:
- In a $3 \times 3$ shape, there are 8 red tiles, which is $3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8$.
- In a $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 12 red tiles, which is $4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12$.
- In a $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 16 red tiles, which is $5^2 - 9 = 25 - 9 = 16$.

The number of red tiles is $n^2 - (n-2)^2$. We can simplify this expression:
$$n^2 - (n-2)^2 = n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = n^2 - n^2 + 4n - 4 = 4n - 4$$

For the total number of tiles:
- In a $3 \times 3$ shape, the total is 9 tiles, which is $3^2$.
- In a $4 \times 4$ shape, the total is 16 tiles, which is $4^2$.
- In a $5 \times 5$ shape, the total is 25 tiles, which is $5^2$.

The total number of tiles is $n^2$, which is simply the area of the square.

So, the completed line for shape $n \times n$ in the table should be:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Shape & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Black Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Number of \\
Red Tiles \\
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}
Total Number \\
of Tiles \\
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
$n \times n$ & $(n-2)^{2}$ & $4n - 4$ & $n^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Answer:
- Number of Black Tiles: \((n-2)^{2}\)
- Number of Red Tiles: \(4n - 4\)
- Total Number of Tiles: \(n^2\)

To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply its length by its width. In this case, the length is given as \( x + 2 \) and the width is given as \( x \).

The area \( A \) is calculated as follows:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ A = (x + 2) \times x \]
\[ A = x \times x + 2 \times x \]
\[ A = x^2 + 2x \]

So the area of the rectangle is \( x^2 + 2x \).

To solve the inequality $9x - 6 < 4x + 4$, follow these steps:

1. Move all the terms with an x to one side of the inequality and the constant terms to the other side. To do this, subtract 4x from both sides:
\[ 9x - 6 - 4x < 4x + 4 - 4x \]
\[ 5x - 6 < 4 \]

2. Now, isolate x by adding 6 to both sides of the inequality:
\[ 5x - 6 + 6 < 4 + 6 \]
\[ 5x < 10 \]

3. Finally, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:
\[ \frac{5x}{5} < \frac{10}{5} \]
\[ x < 2 \]

The given sequence is a list of fractions where the numerator is one less than the denominator for each term. The pattern is that with each step, both the numerator and the denominator increase by 1. 

The first term is \(\frac{1}{2}\), the second term is \(\frac{2}{3}\), and this pattern continues with \(\frac{3}{4}\), \(\frac{4}{5}\), and \(\frac{5}{6}\).

To find the next term, we add 1 to both the numerator and the denominator of the last term. So, if the last term is \(\frac{5}{6}\), the next term will be \(\frac{5+1}{6+1}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{6}{7}\).

Answer: \(\frac{6}{7}\)

\section{M042198B}
This question is a free text response type.

The given sequence is a series of fractions where the numerator is one less than the denominator for each term. The pattern is that each term's numerator is incremented by 1 from the previous term, and the same goes for each term's denominator.

To find the 100th term, we can use the pattern to determine the numerator and denominator for the 100th term. Since the first term has a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2, the 100th term will have a numerator which is 1 less than its term number, and a denominator which is the term number itself. 

So for the 100th term:
- The numerator would be 100 - 1 = 99
- The denominator would be 100

Hence, the 100th term of the sequence would be:
$$
\frac{99}{100}

-------------------------------------------
\section{M042228}
This appears to be a free-text response question, where you are asked to find the value of \( x \) in a given pattern.

To solve for \( x \), let's look for a pattern in the numbers provided. We can see that the numbers increase as we move from left to right and from top to bottom. It seems that the pattern involves adding a constant number to get from one number to the next in a sequence.

Let's start by examining the horizontal sequences:

- In the top row, going from 2 to 4, we add 2, and from 4 to 6, we also add 2. Continuing this pattern, from 6 to 8, we add 2.
- In the second row, going from 6 to 10, we add 4, and from 10 to 14, we add 4. The difference is consistent here as well.

Now let's examine the vertical sequences:

- In the first column, going from 2 to 6, we add 4, and from 6 to 16, we add 10. It seems the difference is not consistent here, so let's try another column.
- In the second column, going from 4 to 10, we add 6, and from 10 to the unknown number \( x \), we should add the same difference if the pattern holds. 

To find the pattern in the vertical sequences, let's look at the differences:

- From 2 to 6, the difference is 4.
- From 6 to 16, the difference is 10.

It looks like the difference between the numbers is increasing by 6 each time (since 10 - 4 = 6). If we apply this pattern, the next difference (from 16 to the number in the box below it) should be 16 (since 10 + 6 = 16).

Now we can calculate the value of \( x \):

- Starting with 16 and adding 16 gives us 32. So the number below 16 is 32.
- Now we need to find the vertical pattern for the second column. Since the difference between 4 and 10 is 6, and the difference between 10 and \( x \) should also follow the pattern, we need to determine this difference. From 16 to 32, the difference is 16, so the difference between the numbers in the second column should also increase by 10 (since 16 - 6 = 10). Therefore, the difference between 10 and \( x \) should be 16.
- Adding 16 to 10 gives us the value of \( x \): \( x = 10 + 16 = 26 \).

Answer: \( x = 26 \).

\section{M042235}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve the system of equations, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I will use the elimination method.

1. Write down the two equations:
   \(x + y = 12\) (Equation 1)
   \(2x + 5y = 36\) (Equation 2)

2. Multiply Equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficient of x the same in both equations:
   \(2x + 2y = 24\) (Equation 3)

3. Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to eliminate x:
   \((2x + 5y) - (2x + 2y) = 36 - 24\)
   \(3y = 12\)

4. Solve for y:
   \(y = 12 / 3\)
   \(y = 4\)

5. Substitute the value of y back into Equation 1 to find x:
   \(x + 4 = 12\)
   \(x = 12 - 4\)
   \(x = 8\)

Answer: [D] \(x=8, y=4\)

To solve this problem, we need to combine like terms. The like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power.

Step 1: Combine the terms with \( p^2 \).
We have \( 3p^2 \) and \( 2p^2 \), so adding them together gives us \( 3p^2 + 2p^2 = 5p^2 \).

Step 2: Combine the terms with \( p \).
We have \( 2p \) and \( p \), so adding them together gives us \( 2p + p = 3p \).

Step 3: Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2.
We get \( 5p^2 + 3p \).

To solve this question, we need to substitute the given pairs of numbers $(x, y)$ into each equation and check which equation is satisfied by both pairs.

1. For the first pair $(0,-1)$:
   - [A] $x+y=-1$ becomes $0+(-1)=-1$, which is true.
   - [B] $2x+y=5$ becomes $2(0)+(-1)=5$, which is false.
   - [C] $3x-y=0$ becomes $3(0)-(-1)=0$, which is false.
   - [D] $4x-y=1$ becomes $4(0)-(-1)=1$, which is true.

2. For the second pair $(1,3)$:
   - [A] $x+y=-1$ becomes $1+3=-1$, which is false.
   - [B] $2x+y=5$ becomes $2(1)+3=5$, which is true.
   - [C] $3x-y=0$ becomes $3(1)-3=0$, which is true.
   - [D] $4x-y=1$ becomes $4(1)-3=1$, which is true.

Now, we need to find the equation that is true for both pairs. From the above checks, we can see that:

- Option [A] is only true for the first pair.
- Option [B] is only true for the second pair.
- Option [C] is not true for either pair.
- Option [D] is true for both pairs.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\section{M052002}
1. This question is a free text response question.

2. The first step is to set up an equation that represents the total length of the piece of wood. We know that the wood was originally 40 cm long and it was cut into three pieces with lengths given by the expressions $2x-5$, $x+7$, and $x+6$. Therefore, the sum of these three pieces should equal the original length of the wood:

\[2x - 5 + x + 7 + x + 6 = 40\]

Next, we combine like terms to simplify the equation:

\[4x + 8 = 40\]

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for $x$:

\[4x = 32\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[x = 8\]

Now that we have the value of $x$, we can determine the lengths of each piece by substituting $x$ back into the expressions:

The first piece: $2x - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11$ cm
The second piece: $x + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15$ cm
The third piece: $x + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14$ cm

3. The length of the longest piece is therefore the second piece, which measures $15$ cm.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the hole in terms of the number of cubes that would fit into it. By looking at the image, we can count the number of cubes along each dimension of the hole.

From the top view, it appears that the hole is 3 cubes long and 2 cubes wide. However, we cannot see the depth of the hole directly from the image. We can infer the depth by looking at the visible layers of cubes. There is one layer of cubes visible on the top of the shape, and since the hole goes "all the way through," it must pass through two layers of cubes (the top layer and the bottom layer).

So, the hole is 3 cubes long, 2 cubes wide, and 2 cubes deep. To find the total number of cubes needed to fill the hole, we multiply these dimensions together:

3 (length) x 2 (width) x 2 (depth) = 12 cubes

\section{M032116}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the perimeter of a square, we first need to find the length of one side. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \), we can find the length of one side by taking the square root of the area.

Step 1: Find the length of one side of the square.
The area of the square is \( 144 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \), so the length of one side is \( \sqrt{144 \mathrm{~cm}^2} = 12 \mathrm{~cm} \).

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the square.
The perimeter of a square is given by \( 4 \times \text{side} \), so we multiply the length of one side by 4.
\( \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times 12 \mathrm{~cm} = 48 \mathrm{~cm} \).

Answer: [B] $48 \mathrm{~cm}$

\section{M032324}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to find the midpoints of AB and BC and then calculate the distance between these midpoints.

Step 1: Find the midpoint of AB.
Since AB is 10 cm, the midpoint of AB will be 5 cm from A and 5 cm from B.

Step 2: Find the midpoint of BC.
Since BC is 5.2 cm, the midpoint of BC will be 2.6 cm from B and 2.6 cm from C.

Step 3: Calculate the distance between the midpoints of AB and BC.
The distance between the midpoints will be the sum of half of AB (which is 5 cm) and half of BC (which is 2.6 cm) minus the full length of segment BC (since B is between A and C, and we are looking for the distance between the midpoints, not the full segments).

So, the distance between the midpoints is 5 cm + 2.6 cm - 5.2 cm = 7.6 cm - 5.2 cm = 2.4 cm.

Answer: [A] $2.4 \mathrm{~cm}$

\section{M032331}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to consider how many degrees the minute hand moves in one hour and then calculate the total movement from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.

The minute hand completes a full circle, which is $360^{\circ}$, in one hour. From 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., the minute hand will move from the 4 on the clock (which represents 20 minutes) to the 12 on the clock (which represents 60 minutes). This is a movement of $\frac{2}{3}$ of a full circle because 20 minutes is $\frac{1}{3}$ of an hour, and the minute hand needs to cover the remaining $\frac{2}{3}$ of the hour to reach the full hour at 7:00 a.m.

So, from 6:20 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., the minute hand moves through:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 360^{\circ} = 240^{\circ} \]

From 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., the minute hand completes another full circle, which is:
\[ 360^{\circ} \]

Adding these two movements together gives us the total degrees the minute hand turns through from 6:20 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.:
\[ 240^{\circ} + 360^{\circ} = 600^{\circ} \]

Answer: [B] $600^{\circ}$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the correct sequence of transformations, let's analyze the changes from Figure 1 to Figure 2, and then from Figure 2 to Figure 3.

From Figure 1 to Figure 2:
- The shape remains the same, but its orientation changes. The right angle that was at the bottom left in Figure 1 is at the bottom right in Figure 2. This suggests a reflection over a vertical axis.

From Figure 2 to Figure 3:
- The shape has been rotated. The right angle that was at the bottom right in Figure 2 is now at the top right in Figure 3. This suggests a clockwise rotation.

Considering the options given, we are looking for a reflection followed by a clockwise rotation.

Answer: [B] reflection and then \(\frac{1}{4}\) turn rotation clockwise

\section{M032398}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the value of \( x \), we need to use the properties of angles in triangles. 

First, let's consider the large triangle on the left. It has one angle that measures \( 45^\circ \) and another that is \( x \). Since the sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \), the third angle in this triangle, which is also part of the smaller triangle on the right, must measure \( 180^\circ - 45^\circ - x \).

Now, let's look at the smaller triangle on the right. We know one angle is \( 65^\circ \), another is \( 30^\circ \), and the third angle, which we found from the larger triangle, is \( 180^\circ - 45^\circ - x \). The sum of angles in this triangle must also be \( 180^\circ \), so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 65^\circ + 30^\circ + (180^\circ - 45^\circ - x) = 180^\circ \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ 95^\circ + 135^\circ - x = 180^\circ \]
\[ 230^\circ - x = 180^\circ \]
\[ x = 230^\circ - 180^\circ \]
\[ x = 50^\circ \]

However, \( 50^\circ \) is not one of the options provided, which suggests there might be an error in our calculation or in the options given. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

- The sum of the angles in the large triangle is indeed \( 180^\circ \).
- The angle opposite to \( x \) in the large triangle is \( 180^\circ - 45^\circ - x = 135^\circ - x \).
- The sum of the angles in the smaller triangle should be \( 65^\circ + 30^\circ + (135^\circ - x) = 180^\circ \).
- Simplifying this gives us \( 95^\circ + 135^\circ - x = 180^\circ \), which simplifies to \( 230^\circ - x = 180^\circ \).
- Solving for \( x \) gives us \( x = 230^\circ - 180^\circ \), which is indeed \( 50^\circ \).

Since \( 50^\circ \) is not an option and the calculation appears to be correct, there may be an error in the provided options or in the diagram. Without additional information or correct options, we cannot determine the correct answer from the given choices.

\section{M032402}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine if triangle $PQR$ is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's evaluate each option:

[A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$ - This is an expression of the Pythagorean theorem. If this equation holds true, it would mean that the triangle is right-angled with sides of 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm, where 5 cm is the hypotenuse. Let's check the math: $3^{2}+4^{2} = 9 + 16 = 25$, and $5^{2} = 25$. Since both sides of the equation are equal, this supports the triangle being a right-angled triangle.

[B] $5<3+4$ - This statement is true (since $5 < 7$), and it indicates that the triangle inequality theorem holds, which is a necessary condition for the existence of a triangle, but it does not specifically indicate that the triangle is right-angled.

[C] $3+4=12-5$ - This statement is true (since $7 = 7$), but it does not relate to the properties that define a right-angled triangle.

[D] $3>5-4$ - This statement is true (since $3 > 1$), but again, it does not relate to the properties that define a right-angled triangle.

Answer: [A] $3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}$

Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the white triangle from the area of the entire rectangle.

First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length times width. The length is 16 cm and the width is 6 cm.

Area of rectangle = length × width = 16 cm × 6 cm = 96 cm²

Next, we calculate the area of the white triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is 1/2 times base times height. The base of the triangle is 8 cm and the height is 6 cm.

Area of triangle = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × 8 cm × 6 cm = 4 cm × 6 cm = 24 cm²

Now, subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region.

Area of shaded region = Area of rectangle - Area of triangle = 96 cm² - 24 cm² = 72 cm²

Answer: [D] 72

\section{M032679}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine the shape of the cutout figure, we need to consider the folding and cutting process described. The paper is folded in half, and then a cut is made along the dotted line. When the paper is unfolded, the cut will create a symmetrical shape because the fold acts as a line of symmetry.

The dotted line is diagonal, and it starts from one corner of the folded paper and ends 1 cm away from the adjacent side. This means that when the paper is unfolded, the cut will form two identical triangles that are mirror images of each other along the fold line.

Since the dotted line is not perpendicular to the base (the side of the rectangle), the triangles formed will not be right triangles. They will have two equal sides (the original 4 cm side of the rectangle and the diagonal cut), making them isosceles triangles. However, since the base of the triangles (the 1 cm segment) is not equal to the other two sides, they cannot be equilateral triangles.

Therefore, the cutout figure will consist of two identical isosceles triangles, which are mirror images of each other along the fold line.

Answer: [B] two isosceles triangles

\section{M032692}
The question asks for the sum of all the interior angles of a pentagon, which is a five-sided polygon. To find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon, we can use the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°

where n is the number of sides of the polygon.

For a pentagon, n = 5. Plugging this into the formula:

Sum of interior angles = (5 - 2) × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 3 × 180°
Sum of interior angles = 540°

Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of pentagon $A B C D E$ is 540 degrees.

To complete the diagram showing the shape from directly above after the triangle flaps have been folded up, follow these steps:

1. The central square will remain the same since it is the base of the shape.
2. The triangle flaps, when folded up, will no longer be visible from directly above as they will be perpendicular to the base square.
3. Therefore, the completed diagram from above will simply be the square without any visible triangle flaps.

Answer: The square shown in the second image is already correct and represents the view from directly above after the triangle flaps have been folded up. No additional drawing is required.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To determine which shape has a line of symmetry, we need to look at each shape and imagine folding it along a line where both halves would match exactly.

A. The shape is a trapezoid and does not have a line of symmetry as the sides and angles are not the same on both halves.
B. This shape is a triangle with one line of symmetry down the middle, where the two sides are mirror images of each other.
C. This shape is a parallelogram, and it does not have a line of symmetry as the opposite sides are parallel but not the same length, so folding it over would not result in matching halves.
D. The shape is a right-angled triangle, but it does not have a line of symmetry because the sides and angles are not the same on both halves.

Answer: [B].

\section{M042152}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this, we need to visualize the triangle in the first image being rotated 180 degrees (a half-turn) clockwise around point O. When you rotate an object 180 degrees, the object's position relative to the center of rotation is reversed. 

Let's consider the position of the triangle in the first image. The right angle is pointing up and to the right, and the hypotenuse is on the bottom side. After a half-turn clockwise, the right angle will point down and to the left, and the hypotenuse will be on the top side.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. The triangle is upside down compared to the original position, but it is not rotated correctly. It appears to have been flipped vertically rather than rotated.
B. The triangle is in the correct orientation after a half-turn clockwise rotation. The right angle now points down and to the left, and the hypotenuse is on the top.
C. The triangle is in the same orientation as the original, which means it has not been rotated at all.
D. The triangle is rotated, but it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, not 180 degrees.

Answer: [B].

This is a free-text response question.

To find the value of \(x\), we need to use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

The volume of the box is given as \(200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\), the width is \(5 \mathrm{~cm}\), and the height is \(4 \mathrm{~cm}\). We can set up the equation:

\[ 200 = x \times 5 \times 4 \]

Now, we need to solve for \(x\):

\[ x \times 20 = 200 \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(10 \mathrm{~cm}\).

Answer: \(10 \mathrm{~cm}\)

\section{M042270}
This is a drawing question where the task is to draw an isosceles triangle with specific dimensions on a grid.

To draw an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm on the provided grid, follow these steps:

1. Choose a starting point on the grid that has enough space above it to accommodate the height of the triangle. This will be one end of the base of the triangle.
2. Count four squares to the right from the starting point. Mark this point as well. This will be the other end of the base of the triangle.
3. From the starting point, count five squares upwards to find the height of the triangle. Mark this point directly above the midpoint of the base. This will be the apex of the triangle.
4. Draw straight lines from the apex to each of the base points to complete the isosceles triangle.

Remember, each side of the small squares represents 1 cm, so you can use the grid lines to measure the lengths accurately.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with requests that involve creating or modifying images. However, I can guide you through the process.

1. To mark the point \( B(3,30^{\circ}) \), you would find the 30-degree line on the graph and count out to the third circle from the origin along that line. This is where you would place point B.

2. To mark the point \( C(4,120^{\circ}) \), you would find the 120-degree line on the graph and count out to the fourth circle from the origin along that line. This is where you would place point C.

Once you have marked points B and C:

3. To draw the angle \( BOC \), you would draw a line segment from point B to the origin O, and another line segment from point C to the origin O.

4. To find the measure of angle \( BOC \), you would calculate the difference in degrees between the lines \( OB \) and \( OC \). Since \( OB \) is at 30 degrees and \( OC \) is at 120 degrees, the angle \( BOC \) would be \( 120^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 90^{\circ} \).

Therefore, angle \( BOC = 90^{\circ} \).

\section{M052084}
Type of question: Multiple choice

To find the area of the square, we first need to determine the length of one side of the square. Since the perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides and a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.

Given that the perimeter is $36 \mathrm{~cm}$, we divide this by 4 to find the length of one side:

$36 \mathrm{~cm} \div 4 = 9 \mathrm{~cm}$

Now that we know one side of the square is $9 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can find the area by squaring this length (since the area of a square is the length of one side squared):

Area = side length × side length = $9 \mathrm{~cm} \times 9 \mathrm{~cm} = 81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

Answer: [A] $81 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

\section{M052206}
This is a free text response question, where we need to calculate the number of books that can fit into the box based on the dimensions given.

To find out the largest number of books that will fit inside the box, we need to compare the dimensions of the book with those of the box to determine how many books can fit along each dimension of the box.

The book has dimensions of 20 cm x 15 cm x 6 cm, and the box has dimensions of 36 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm. We need to figure out how to orient the books to maximize the number that can fit.

Let's consider the dimensions of the box and the book:

1. If we place the books with the 20 cm side along the 36 cm side of the box, we can fit 1 book along that side (as \(36 \div 20 = 1\) with a remainder, meaning there's not enough space for a second book of 20 cm).
2. Along the 30 cm side of the box, we can place the books with the 15 cm side of the book, fitting 2 books (as \(30 \div 15 = 2\), exactly).
3. For the height of the box, which is 20 cm, we can stack the books with their 6 cm side vertically, fitting 3 books (as \(20 \div 6 = 3\) with a remainder).

Therefore, for each layer of books in the box, we can fit \(1 \times 2 = 2\) books, and we can stack 3 layers of books. Thus, the total number of books that can fit in the box is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) books.

Answer: 6

\section{M052362}
This is a free-text response question.

To find the size of angle B, we need to understand the properties of the triangle given the information provided:

1. \(AC = BC\): This tells us that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles, with \(AC\) and \(BC\) being the equal sides. Therefore, angles \(CAB\) and \(CBA\) are also equal.

2. \(AB\) is twice as long as \(CX\): Since \(CX\) is part of \(AX\), and \(AX\) is part of \(AB\), we can infer that \(CX\) is less than half of \(AB\). This means that \(AX\) is longer than \(CX\), and \(AB\) is the sum of \(AX\) and \(XB\), which are equal because \(AC = BC\) and \(CX\) is a height that divides the base \(AB\) into two equal parts in an isosceles triangle.

3. Since \(CX\) is perpendicular to \(AB\), it means that \(CXB\) is a right angle, so \(CXB = 90\) degrees.

Since angles \(CAB\) and \(CBA\) are equal and the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180\) degrees, we can set up an equation to find the measure of angle \(B\):

Let \( \theta \) be the measure of angles \(CAB\) and \(CBA\). Then:

\[ \theta + \theta + 90^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2\theta + 90^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2\theta = 180^\circ - 90^\circ \]
\[ 2\theta = 90^\circ \]
\[ \theta = \frac{90^\circ}{2} \]
\[ \theta = 45^\circ \]

Therefore, the size of angle \(B\) (which is the same as angle \(CBA\)) is \(45^\circ\).

Answer: \(45^\circ\)

\section{M052408}
This is a free-text response question involving angle calculations with parallel lines and a transversal.

To find the value of $b$, we can use the fact that when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are equal. In this diagram, the angle marked $60^\circ$ and the angle marked $b^\circ$ are alternate interior angles. Therefore, they must be equal because lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel.

So, the value of $b$ is:

\[ b = 60^\circ \]

Answer: [60 degrees].

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of Peter getting a pink candy after Megan has already gotten one.

Initially, there were an equal number of blue, pink, yellow, and green candies. Since there are 100 candies in total and 4 colors, there must have been 25 candies of each color.

After Megan took a pink candy, there are now 24 pink candies left and 99 candies in total.

The probability of Peter getting a pink candy is the number of pink candies left divided by the total number of candies left. So, the probability is 24/99.

When Megan took a candy, the probability of her getting a pink candy was 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4 or 25/100.

Comparing the probabilities, 24/99 is slightly less than 25/100 because when the numerator decreases and the denominator decreases by a smaller amount, the fraction becomes smaller.

Therefore, it is less likely for Peter to get a pink candy than it was for Megan.

Answer: [D] It is less likely than it was for Megan.

To solve this, we need to determine the probability of the spinner landing on the red sector and then apply that probability to the total number of spins.

1. Count the number of sectors on the spinner. There are 5 sectors in total.
2. Since the spinner is divided into equal parts, each sector has an equal chance of being landed on. Therefore, the probability of landing on any one sector, including the red sector, is 1 out of 5 or 1/5.
3. To find out how many times the spinner is expected to land on the red sector out of 600 spins, multiply the total number of spins by the probability of landing on the red sector: 600 * (1/5) = 120.

However, none of the provided options ([A] 30, [B] 40, [C] 50, [D] 60) match the calculated expectation of 120 spins. There might be an error in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculation, the expected number of times the spinner should land on the red sector out of 600 spins would be 120, which is not listed in the options.

Answer: None of the options match the calculated expectation of 120 spins.

\section{M032681A}
To determine by what time a total of 150 cars had been produced, we need to locate the point on the graph where the solid line crosses the 150 mark on the y-axis, which represents the total number of cars produced.

Starting from the 150 mark on the y-axis, we move horizontally to the right until we intersect with the solid line. From this intersection point, we move vertically downwards to find the corresponding time on the x-axis.

Looking at the graph, the solid line intersects the 150 mark on the y-axis between 11 am and 12 noon. The intersection appears to be closer to 12 noon, but it's not exactly at 12 noon. It's slightly before that.

Therefore, by estimating the position of the intersection, we can conclude that a total of 150 cars had been produced slightly before 12 noon. It's not possible to give an exact minute without more precise scaling, but it's clearly before 12 noon, perhaps around 11:50 am or so, based on the graph provided.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
To find the average number of cars produced per hour on this day, we need to look at the total number of cars produced by the end of the day and divide that by the number of hours of production.

From the graph, it appears that production starts at 8 am and ends at 4 pm, which is a total of 8 hours.

The solid line indicates the actual car production, and it reaches its highest point at 4 pm. The value at 4 pm on the y-axis represents the total number of cars produced in the day. It looks like the solid line reaches just about the 350 mark on the y-axis at 4 pm.

To calculate the average number of cars produced per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of cars produced}}{\text{Total number of hours}} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{350 \text{ cars}}{8 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 43.75 \text{ cars per hour} \]

Therefore, the average number of cars produced per hour on this day was 43.75.

This is a free-text response question where you are asked to analyze a graph to determine during which hour the most cars were produced by the NU Car Motor Company.

To find the hour during which the most cars were produced, look for the steepest part of the solid line, which represents the greatest increase in the total number of cars produced over the shortest period of time. The steepest section of the graph indicates the highest production rate.

On the provided graph, the solid line shows a noticeable increase in steepness starting at around 1 pm and continuing until 2 pm. This suggests that during the hour between 1 pm and 2 pm, the production rate was the highest, and consequently, the most cars were produced.

Answer: The most cars were produced between 1 pm and 2 pm.

This is a drawing question, where you need to create a pie chart based on the given data. Here's how you can think about creating the pie chart:

1. Calculate the total number of students planning to enter the workforce by subtracting the sum of students going to university, polytechnic school, and business college from the total number of students: 400 - (50 + 100 + 150) = 100 students.

2. Calculate the percentage of students for each category:
   - University: 50/400 = 0.125 or 12.5%
   - Polytechnic School: 100/400 = 0.25 or 25%
   - Business College: 150/400 = 0.375 or 37.5%
   - Workforce: 100/400 = 0.25 or 25%

3. Convert these percentages into degrees for the pie chart, as a full circle is 360 degrees:
   - University: 12.5% of 360 degrees = 45 degrees
   - Polytechnic School: 25% of 360 degrees = 90 degrees
   - Business College: 37.5% of 360 degrees = 135 degrees
   - Workforce: 25% of 360 degrees = 90 degrees

4. Draw the pie chart segments using the calculated degree measurements. Start from the top of the circle (12 o'clock position) and measure clockwise:
   - The first segment for the university would be a 45-degree slice.
   - The next segment for the polytechnic school would start where the university segment ends and would be a 90-degree slice.
   - The business college segment would follow with a 135-degree slice.
   - The last segment for the workforce would also be a 90-degree slice, completing the circle.

5. Label each segment with its respective category name: University, Polytechnic School, Business College, and Workforce.

Since I cannot physically draw on the image, this description should guide you in creating the pie chart with the given proportions and labels.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to estimate the rate of change for the sales of Cherry Cola and Lemon Cola and then project when the two will intersect.

From the graph, we can see that the sales of Cherry Cola are increasing each year, while the sales of Lemon Cola are decreasing each year. We need to estimate the average yearly change in sales for each type of soft drink.

For Cherry Cola:
- In 1998, sales are approximately 10 million cans.
- In 2001, sales are approximately 30 million cans.
- The increase over 3 years is 20 million cans.
- The average yearly increase is therefore about 20 million cans / 3 years = 6.67 million cans per year.

For Lemon Cola:
- In 1998, sales are approximately 60 million cans.
- In 2001, sales are approximately 50 million cans.
- The decrease over 3 years is 10 million cans.
- The average yearly decrease is therefore about 10 million cans / 3 years = 3.33 million cans per year.

Now, we need to determine when the sales of Cherry Cola will equal the sales of Lemon Cola. We can set up an equation where the sales of Cherry Cola plus its yearly increase times the number of years equals the sales of Lemon Cola minus its yearly decrease times the number of years.

Let x be the number of years after 2001 when the sales will be equal.

\( 30 + 6.67x = 50 - 3.33x \)

Combine like terms:

\( 6.67x + 3.33x = 50 - 30 \)

\( 10x = 20 \)

Divide both sides by 10 to solve for x:

\( x = 2 \)

Since x represents the number of years after 2001, we add 2 to 2001 to find the year when the sales will be equal:

2001 + 2 = 2003

Answer: [A] 2003

To find the mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up the total number of staff members across all restaurants.
2. Divide that total by the number of restaurants to find the average.

Let's do the calculation:

Step 1: Add up the number of staff members.
$12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30 = 100$

Step 2: Divide the total by the number of restaurants.
$100 \div 5 = 20$

Answer: The mean number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is [20].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042169B}
1. This is a free text response question.

2. To find the median number of staff members, we need to arrange the numbers in ascending order and then find the middle number. Since there are 5 data points, the median will be the third number when they are listed in order.

The numbers in ascending order are: $12, 18, 19, 21, 30$.

Since there are 5 numbers, the middle one is the third number, which is 19.

3. The median number of staff members in the 5 restaurants is [19].
-------------------------------------------
\section{M042169C}
Type of question: Free text response

To solve this, we first need to understand what the median and mean are. The median is the middle number when a set of numbers is ordered from least to greatest. The mean is the average of a set of numbers.

Step 1: Determine the current median and mean before the staff increase.
- To find the median, we arrange the numbers in ascending order: 12, 18, 19, 21, 30. Since there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle number, which is 19.
- To find the mean, we add up all the numbers and divide by the total count: (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 100 / 5 = 20.

Step 2: Determine the new median and mean after the staff increase.
- The new set of numbers will be: 12, 18, 19, 21, 50. The median will still be the middle number, which is still 19 since the increase did not affect the middle value.
- To find the new mean, we add up the new set of numbers and divide by the count: (12 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 50) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

So, the median would remain the same at 19, but the mean would increase from 20 to 24.

Answer:
- The median would remain unchanged.
- The mean would increase.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate 50% of the total number of bottles (1,200) that the shopkeeper will order. 

Step by step, the calculation is as follows:
1. Convert the percentage to a decimal: 50% = 0.50
2. Multiply the total number of bottles by the decimal: 1,200 bottles * 0.50 = 600 bottles

Answer: [C] 600

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of taking out either a blue button or a white button. The total number of buttons is the sum of red, blue, and white buttons, which is 10 + 8 + 4 = 22 buttons.

The number of favorable outcomes for a blue button is 8, and for a white button is 4. Since these are two separate and non-overlapping events (a button cannot be both blue and white), we can add the number of favorable outcomes for each event to get the total number of favorable outcomes for either event. That is 8 (blue) + 4 (white) = 12.

Now, the probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of taking out either a blue button or a white button is 12 (favorable outcomes) divided by 22 (total outcomes).

Therefore, the probability is $\frac{12}{22}$ which can be simplified to $\frac{6}{11}$, but since the answer choices are not simplified, we choose the unsimplified fraction.

Answer: [D] $\frac{12}{22}$

\section{M042207}
This is a drawing question. You are asked to use the data provided in the table to complete and label a pie chart.

To fill out the pie chart, we need to calculate the percentage of the total for each sport and then convert those percentages into angles for the pie chart (since a full circle is 360 degrees). Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of students: 
   Hockey + Football + Tennis + Basketball = 60 + 180 + 120 + 120 = 480 students

2. Calculate the percentage for each sport:
   - Hockey: (60 / 480) * 100% = 12.5%
   - Football: (180 / 480) * 100% = 37.5%
   - Tennis: (120 / 480) * 100% = 25%
   - Basketball: (120 / 480) * 100% = 25%

3. Convert these percentages into angles:
   - Hockey: 12.5% of 360 degrees = 0.125 * 360 = 45 degrees
   - Football: 37.5% of 360 degrees = 0.375 * 360 = 135 degrees
   - Tennis: 25% of 360 degrees = 0.25 * 360 = 90 degrees
   - Basketball: 25% of 360 degrees = 0.25 * 360 = 90 degrees

4. Draw and label the pie chart:
   - Start from the top of the circle and measure out the angle for each sport using a protractor.
   - For Hockey, measure a 45-degree angle from the top and draw a line to create the Hockey segment.
   - Next, from the end of the Hockey segment, measure out a 135-degree angle for Football and draw a line to create the Football segment.
   - Then, from the end of the Football segment, measure out a 90-degree angle for Tennis and draw a line to create the Tennis segment.
   - The remaining segment will be for Basketball, which should also be a 90-degree angle.
   - Label each segment with the name of the sport and its corresponding percentage or number of students.

Please note that I cannot physically draw on the image, but this description should guide you on how to complete and label the pie chart based on the data provided.

To answer this question, we need to look at the election results given in the LaTeX format. According to the results, Pat received 80% of the votes, and Chris received 20% of the votes.

Step by step, we can reason that if a student is chosen at random, the likelihood of them having voted for Pat is based on the percentage of votes Pat received. Since Pat received 80% of the votes, this means that out of every 100 students, 80 would have voted for Pat. This is a high percentage, indicating that it is more probable than not for a randomly selected student to have voted for Pat.

Answer: [B] It is likely that the student voted for Pat.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To answer this question, we need to consider what information can be directly inferred from the given averages.

The average length of jumps for Team A is 3.6 m, and for Team B, it's 4.8 m. Since there were the same number of students in each team, we can conclude that the total length of all jumps by Team B is greater than that of Team A. This is because if each team has the same number of students, and Team B's average is higher, their total must also be higher.

Now let's consider each statement:

[A] We cannot be sure that each student in Team B jumped farther than any student in Team A just based on the average. It is possible that some students in Team A jumped farther than the average of Team B, but the overall average was brought down by other shorter jumps.

[B] This statement is similar to [A] in that it assumes that all students in Team B outperformed all students in Team A, which cannot be concluded from the average alone.

[C] This statement is true because the average jump length for Team B is higher than that for Team A, and since the number of students is the same in both teams, the total jump length for Team B must be greater.

[D] This statement could be true, but we cannot be certain based on the information given. It's possible that some students in Team A could have jumped farther than some in Team B, but the averages do not provide enough information to confirm this.

The only statement that must be true based on the given averages and the fact that the number of students per team is the same is [C].

Answer: [C] As a group, team B jumped farther than team A.

Type of question: Multiple choice

To solve this problem, we need to understand that since Sue puts the marble back into the bag, the second draw is independent of the first draw. This means that the outcome of the first draw does not affect the outcome of the second draw.

The total number of marbles in the bag remains the same, which is 10 marbles. Since there are 5 red marbles and she puts the red marble back, there are still 5 red marbles in the bag.

The probability of drawing a red marble is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles. So, the probability P that the next marble she draws is red is:

\[ P(\text{red marble}) = \frac{\text{number of red marbles}}{\text{total number of marbles}} = \frac{5}{10} \]

Simplifying the fraction gives us:

\[ P(\text{red marble}) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Answer: [A] $\frac{1}{2}$

\section{M052503A}
The age structure of a country can significantly influence its potential for population growth. In the provided graphs, we can analyze the percentage of the population within different age ranges in Country X and Country Y.

In Country X, the base of the pyramid is much broader than the top, which indicates a larger proportion of the population is in the youngest age group (ages 0-19). This wide base suggests that there are many young individuals who will eventually reach reproductive age, leading to a higher birth rate and potential for rapid population growth. The age group that is currently in the reproductive age range (20-44) is also relatively large, which further contributes to the potential for more births in the near future.

In contrast, Country Y has a more uniform distribution across the age groups, with a narrower base. This indicates a smaller proportion of young individuals who will be entering the reproductive age group in the near future. Additionally, the reproductive age group (20-44) is smaller relative to the youngest age group than in Country X, suggesting that there will be fewer individuals having children, leading to slower population growth.

Therefore, the age structure of Country X, with its larger youth population and sizeable group of individuals in the reproductive age, could lead to more rapid population growth compared to Country Y, which has a smaller base of young individuals and a smaller reproductive cohort.

\section{M052503B}
The image shows two population pyramids for Country X and Country Y, which represent the age distribution of their populations. These pyramids can be used to understand the demographic structure and predict future trends in population growth.

Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X for the following reasons:

1. The population pyramid for Country Y shows a larger proportion of the population in the older age group (45-89 years), as indicated by the top section of the pyramid. This suggests that Country Y has a relatively large elderly population.

2. The base of Country Y's pyramid, representing the youngest age group (0-19 years), is narrower than the middle section (20-44 years). This indicates that there are fewer young people entering the workforce compared to the number of older people who will be retiring soon.

3. The narrow base also suggests that Country Y has a lower birth rate, which means that there will be a smaller proportion of working-age people in the future to support the elderly through taxation and social services.

4. In contrast, Country X has a broad base and a much smaller proportion of elderly, indicating rapid population growth and a larger working-age population that can support the elderly.

In summary, Country Y has a relatively larger elderly population and a shrinking younger population, which could lead to a demographic strain as the proportion of the population that needs to be supported grows compared to the proportion that can provide support.
