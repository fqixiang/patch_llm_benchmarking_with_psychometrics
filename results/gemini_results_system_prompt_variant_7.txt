3. The answer is:

$6 \times 6$ shape: 16 black tiles and 20 red tiles, for a total of 36 tiles.

$7 \times 7$ shape: 25 black tiles and 24 red tiles, for a total of 49 tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760A}
 1. The question type is a drawing question. 

2. First, we need to find out the pattern of the number of black and red tiles. 

- For the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles. 
- For the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles. 
- For the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles and 16 red tiles. 

We can see that the number of black tiles is the square of the side length, and the number of red tiles is the side length multiplied by 4.

3. For the shape with a total of 64 tiles, the side length is 8. So there are 8^2=64 black tiles and 8*4=32 red tiles.

4. The answer is 64 black tiles and 32 red tiles.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760B}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.

2. Let's think step by step. We know that the number of black tiles is 49. We also know that the number of red tiles is 3 times the number of black tiles plus 5. So, the number of red tiles is 3 * 49 + 5 = 152.

3. The answer is 152.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032760C}
 1. This is a free-text response question.

2. Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the relationship between the number of black tiles and the number of red tiles in the shapes that Pat made. We can see that for each shape, the number of black tiles is equal to the square of the side length of the shape. For example, for the $3 \times 3$ shape, the side length is 3 and the number of black tiles is $3^2 = 9$. For the $4 \times 4$ shape, the side length is 4 and the number of black tiles is $4^2 = 16$.

3. Next, we need to use this relationship to find out how many black tiles Pat would need to complete the shape that he is making now. We know that the shape has 44 red tiles, so the side length of the shape must be $\sqrt{44} \approx 6.63$. Therefore, the number of black tiles that Pat would need to complete the shape is $6.63^2 \approx 44$.

4. Answer: 44
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032761}
 1. The question type is a free-text response.

2. Let's think step-by-step. In the $3 \times 3$ shape, there is 1 black tile and 8 red tiles. In the $4 \times 4$ shape, there are 4 black tiles and 12 red tiles. In the $5 \times 5$ shape, there are 9 black tiles and 16 red tiles. We can see that the number of black tiles is the square of the number of rows minus 1, and the number of red tiles is 4 times the number of rows minus 4. So, for the shape $n \times n$, the number of black tiles is $(n-2)^2$ and the number of red tiles is $4n-4$. The total number of tiles is $(n-2)^2 + 4n-4$.

3. Answer: $(n-2)^2$, 4n-4, $(n-2)^2 + 4n-4$

\section{M032397}
 1. Type of question: Multiple choice

2. First, we need to identify the differences between Figure 1 and Figure 2. The triangle in Figure 2 is smaller than the triangle in Figure 1, and it is also rotated 90 degrees clockwise. So, we need to find a transformation that will reduce the size of the triangle and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. A reflection will not change the size or orientation of the triangle, so we can eliminate answer choice [A]. A $\frac{1}{4}$ turn rotation clockwise will rotate the triangle 90 degrees clockwise, but it will not change the size of the triangle, so we can eliminate answer choice [B]. A $\frac{1}{2}$ turn rotation will rotate the triangle 180 degrees, which is not what we want, so we can eliminate answer choice [C]. A $\frac{1}{4}$ turn rotation counterclockwise will rotate the triangle 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is not what we want, so we can eliminate answer choice [D]. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct.

3. Answer: None of the above.

\section{M032398}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.

2. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the angle on the left is 45 degrees and the angle on the right is 30 degrees. The angle in the middle is x, and the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, x + 45 + 30 = 180. Combining like terms, we get x + 75 = 180. Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get x = 105.

3. The answer is [D] 105 degrees.

\section{M032402}
 1. The question is a multiple-choice question.


2. To determine if a triangle is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the sides of the triangle are 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. We can calculate the squares of each side: 3^2 = 9, 4^2 = 16, and 5^2 = 25. We can then check if the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied: 9 + 16 = 25. Since the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied, we can conclude that the triangle is a right-angled triangle.


3. The answer is [A].

\section{M032623}
 1. Type of question: Multiple choice.

2. Thought process and reasoning:
The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula $A = bh$.

The figure above shows a rectangle with a triangle removed from it. The base of the rectangle is 8 cm, and the height of the rectangle is 6 cm. The base of the triangle is 8 cm, and the height of the triangle is 6 cm.

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to find the area of the rectangle and subtract the area of the triangle.

The area of the rectangle is $A = 8 cm \cdot 6 cm = 48 cm^2$.

The area of the triangle is $A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 cm \cdot 6 cm = 24 cm^2$.

The area of the shaded region is $48 cm^2 - 24 cm^2 = 24 cm^2$.

\section{M042150}
 1. The question is asking which shape has a line of symmetry. A line of symmetry is a line that divides a shape into two mirror images.


2. I would first look at each shape and see if I can identify any lines of symmetry. A line of symmetry must pass through the center of the shape. For example, shape A has no line of symmetry because there is no line that can be drawn through the center of the shape that will divide it into two mirror images. Shape B has one line of symmetry, which is the line that passes through the vertex of the triangle and the midpoint of the opposite side. Shape C has two lines of symmetry, which are the lines that pass through the center of the square. Shape D has no lines of symmetry.

 1. The question is a free text response question.

2. The volume of a rectangular box is given by the formula:

$$V = lwh$$

where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

In this question, we are given the volume of the box (200 cm3), the width (4 cm), and the height (5 cm). We are asked to find the length (x).

To find the length, we can rearrange the formula for the volume of a rectangular box as follows:

$$l = \frac{V}{wh}$$

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

$$l = \frac{200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}{(4 \mathrm{~cm})(5 \mathrm{~cm})}$$

$$l = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$$

Therefore, the value of x is 10 cm.

 1. Type of question: Drawing

2. Thought process:
- An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and one different side. 
- The base is the different side, and the other two sides are equal and are called legs.
- The height is the perpendicular distance from the vertex (the point where the two legs meet) to the base.

3. Answer: 
- Draw a horizontal line for the base that is 4cm long, starting at the second column and ending at the 5th column.
- From the end points of the base, draw two lines that meet at a point above the base. The point where the two lines meet is the vertex.
- The height of the triangle is 5cm, so the vertex should be 5cm above the base.
- The two lines that meet at the vertex should be of equal length.

\section{M052362}
 1. Type of question: Free text response.

2. Thought process: 

- Since $AC = BC$, we know that $AX = XB$. 
- Let $AX = XB = a$ and $CX = b$. 
- Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
- We also know that $AB = 2b$. 
- Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we have $a^2 + (2b)^2 = c^2$. 
- Equating the two expressions for $c^2$, we get $a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + 4b^2$. 
- Simplifying, we get $3b^2 = 0$. 
- Since $b$ cannot be zero, we must have $3b^2 = 0$. 
- Therefore, $b = 0$ and $a = c$. 
- This means that $AX = XB = 0$ and $CX = c$. 
- Therefore, angle $B$ is a right angle, or $90$ degrees.

\section{M032681A}
 1. The question is a free-text response question.

2. The question asks us to find the time at which a total of 150 cars have been produced. We can see from the graph that the solid line, which represents the actual number of cars produced, intersects the dotted line, which represents the total number of cars that would be produced if the rate of production were constant, at the point where 150 cars have been produced. This point is at approximately 11:30 am.

3. The answer is 11:30 am.
-------------------------------------------
\section{M032681B}
 1. The question is asking for the average number of cars produced per hour on this day, so the answer should be a number.


2. First, we need to find the total number of cars produced on this day. We can do this by finding the area of the region between the solid line and the x-axis. The area of a triangle is 1/2 (base x height). The base of the triangle is 8 hours (4 pm - 8 am), and the height is 400 cars (the maximum number of cars produced). So, the area of the triangle is 1/2 x 8 x 400 = 1600 cars.

  The area of the rectangle is length x width. The length of the rectangle is 1 hour (3 pm - 2 pm), and the width is 50 cars (the number of cars produced during that hour). So the area of the rectangle is 1 x 50 = 50 cars.
 
 The total area is 1600 + 50 = 1650 cars.


3. Next, we need to find the total number of hours worked. The factory was open for 8 hours (4 pm - 8 am).


4. Finally, we can find the average number of cars produced per hour by dividing the total number of cars produced by the total number of hours worked. 1650 cars / 8 hours = 206.25 cars per hour.


5. Therefore, the answer is 206.25.

- Next, I need to find the proportion of students who plan to go to university. 
- This is 50 / 300 = 1 / 6. 
- I will represent this proportion by 1 sector of the pie chart. 
- Similarly, the proportion of students who plan to go to polytechnic school is 100 / 300 = 1 / 3. 
- I will represent this proportion by 3 sectors of the pie chart. 
- The proportion of students who plan to go to business college is 150 / 300 = 1 / 2.
- I will represent this proportion by 2 sectors of the pie chart. 
- The proportion of students who plan to enter workforce is (400 - 50 - 100 - 150) / 300 = 1 / 6. 
- I will represent this proportion by 1 sector of the pie chart.

3. Answer: 
- The pie chart will have 6 sectors. 
- 1 sector will be labeled "University". 
- 3 sectors will be labeled "Polytechnic school". 
- 2 sectors will be labeled "Business college".

\section{M052503A}
 1. The question type is multiple choice.

2. The graphs show the age structure of the population in two countries, Country X and Country Y. The age structure of a population is the proportion of people in each age group. The graphs show that Country X has a younger age structure than Country Y. This means that there are more people in the younger age groups in Country X than in Country Y.

The younger age structure of Country X could lead to more rapid population growth than the age structure of Country Y. This is because the younger age groups are more likely to have children. So, even if the birth rate is the same in both countries, Country X will have a higher population growth rate because it has more people in the younger age groups.

3. The answer is A.

2. Thought process and reasoning: 
- The graphs show the age structure of each country's population. 
- The population is divided into three age groups from youngest to oldest. 
- The graphs enable predictions about population growth.
- Country Y has a larger percentage of its population in the 0-19 age group than Country X. 
- This means that Country Y will have a larger number of people entering the workforce in the future. 
- However, Country Y also has a larger percentage of its population in the 65+ age group than Country X. 
- This means that Country Y will have a larger number of people retiring and leaving the workforce in the future. 
- Therefore, Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X because it will have fewer workers to support a larger number of retirees.

3. Answer: Country Y could expect to have a bigger problem taking care of its elderly population than Country X because it will have fewer workers to support a larger number of retirees.
