The diagram shows a system for locating points


\includegraphics[max width=0.8\textwidth]{2024_02_20_828ebc9d68bcc1fbb223g-66}


In this system, the position of a point $P$ is described by its distance from origin, $O$, and the amount of counterclockwise turn from a baseline $O A$ to $O P$. Thus, the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(5,340^{\circ}\right)$.

1. Mark the points $B\left(3,30^{\circ}\right)$ and $C\left(4,120^{\circ}\right)$ on the graph above.

2. Draw the angle $B O C$. What is the measure of angle $B O C$ ?

Angle $B O C=\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}^{\circ}$
